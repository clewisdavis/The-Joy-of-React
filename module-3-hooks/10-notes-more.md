## React Hooks

### More to Discover

- We learned about hooks, `useId`, `useRef` and `useEffect` and creating our own custom hooks. But the rabbit hole goes deep.
- There are official hooks to learn more about, `useContext`, and `useReducer`.

#### Leveraging the eco system

- When React relased custom hooks, the community starting to build out amazing libraries to use.
- Third party collections of utility hooks, for example, [react-hookz](https://github.com/react-hookz/web) is an npm package that includes a few dozen hooks.
- So why build your own, sooner or later run into a problem that can't be solved by an off the shelf library.
