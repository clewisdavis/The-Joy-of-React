## React Hooks

### Another tool in the Toolbox

- A way to share business logic throughout our app, without having to stack a bunch of components.
- The tool to solve this, is Hooks.
- Allow you to reuse logic throughout the application.
- Use it to manage a event listener, or data request, can now be packed up and re-used.
- Using Hooks and components together, makes building in React much better.
