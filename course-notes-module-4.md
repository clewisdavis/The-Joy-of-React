## Component API Design

### Introduction

- Most common question, 'How do I create a React apps that scale?"

- Going to learn techniques that keep complexity manageable as apps grow larger and larger.
- Gain new mental models, ways of thinking that will help make architectural decisions in our apps.

- Producers and consumers
- Think of this, the restaurant analogy, the waiter is your 3rd party API, and the waiter is the interface that you use to access you meal. You don't see all that goes on in the kitchen.

- Twitter for example, teams of people just working on that API layer, they decide what the parameters should be, the routes, authentication, permissions.
- Producing and consuming, Twitter developers produce this API, and we consume it.
- Common pattern, every time we install an NPM package, we are consuming something another developer has produced.

- A React component is also like a closed system, like the Twitter example. A React component closes up the markup and styles, we don't have access to that directly, instead, we have access to the interface, which is props.

- As the person developing the components, we can control what props are included and excluded. And we don't think about it. In a React producer and consumer, we wear both hats.

- It may take some time to produce the component, but for years, you will be consuming it.
- If the props, are intuitive and easy to use, it will be easy to use.

- If a component is designed well, produced in a thoughtful manner, the prop interface, will be nice to work with in the future.
