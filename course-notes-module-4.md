## Component API Design

### Introduction

- Most common question, 'How do I create a React apps that scale?"

- Going to learn techniques that keep complexity manageable as apps grow larger and larger.
- Gain new mental models, ways of thinking that will help make architectural decisions in our apps.

- Producers and consumers
- Think of this, the restaurant analogy, the waiter is your 3rd party API, and the waiter is the interface that you use to access you meal. You don't see all that goes on in the kitchen.

- Twitter for example, teams of people just working on that API layer, they decide what the parameters should be, the routes, authentication, permissions.
- Producing and consuming, Twitter developers produce this API, and we consume it.
- Common pattern, every time we install an NPM package, we are consuming something another developer has produced.

- A React component is also like a closed system, like the Twitter example. A React component closes up the markup and styles, we don't have access to that directly, instead, we have access to the interface, which is props.

- As the person developing the components, we can control what props are included and excluded. And we don't think about it. In a React producer and consumer, we wear both hats.

- It may take some time to produce the component, but for years, you will be consuming it.
- If the props, are intuitive and easy to use, it will be easy to use.

- If a component is designed well, produced in a thoughtful manner, the prop interface, will be nice to work with in the future.

### The Spectrum of Components

- Here is a simple implementation of a `<Banner/>` component, meant to show teh user a message.

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';

import styles from './Banner.module.css';

function Banner({ type, user, children }) {
  const backgroundColor = type === 'success'
    ? 'var(--color-success)'
    : 'var(--color-error)';
  
  // Only logged in, verified users are
  // allowed to see the banner
  if (
    !user ||
    user.registrationStatus === 'unverified'
  ) {
    return null;
  }
  
  return (
    <div
      className={styles.banner}
      style={{ backgroundColor }}
    >
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}

export default Banner;
```

- What do you think about this structure?
- An opportunity to do things, in a more flexible and scalable way.

- The spectrum of components.
- On the left, primitive lego bricks we build our application with, reusable and generic.

![spectrum](images/image-23.png)

- But we need things that are more application specific and tied into our business logic.
- As you move along the spectrum we start to be more and more tied into our specific application.

![Alt text](images/image-24.png)

- At the end of the spectrum, the components that are the most tied into our application and business logic.

- Good mental model, every component should be clear where they sit on the spectrum.

- With this in mind, where should this go in our spectrum? How would you structure this?
- Whenever you render our <LoggedInBanner/> it does the business logic check, then it defers to our generic <Banner/>.

```JAVASCRIPT
// Create a new component
// this component can be responsible for the logic
// and then you can return a generic <Banner/>
function LoggedInBanner({ type, user, children }) {
  // Only logged in, verified users are
  // allowed to see the banner
  if (
    !user ||
    user.registrationStatus === 'unverified'
  ) {
    return null;
  }  

  return (
    <Banner type={type}>
      {children}
    </Banner>
  )
}
```

- And now, you have two separate components, that have two separate concerns.
- Purely cosmetic, based on it's type.

```JAVASCRIPT
// Generic Banner
function Banner({ type, children }) {
  const backgroundColor = type === 'success'
    ? 'var(--color-success)'
    : 'var(--color-error)';
   
  return (
    <div
      className={styles.banner}
      style={{ backgroundColor }}
    >
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

- You can export `<LoggedInBanner>`, so you can use it in your `<App>`.
- Then you can use this in the `<App>` component, and if you wanted to just show, if you wanted to just show something all the time. Whether they are logged in or not.

```JAVASCRIPT
// BANNER
import React from 'react';

import Banner from './Banner';

const EXAMPLE_USER = {
  name: 'Sayen',
  registrationStatus: 'verified',
};

function App() {
  return (
    <Banner
      type="success"
    >
      Email to reset password sent!
    </Banner>
    
  );
}

export default App;
```

- But, if you wanted to conditionally show the `Banner` based on log in.
- Import your `LoggedInBanner` and use that in the place of `Banner`

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';

import { LoggedInBanner } from './Banner';

const EXAMPLE_USER = {
  name: 'Sayen',
  registrationStatus: 'verified',
};

function App() {
  return (
    <LoggedInBanner
      type="success"
      user={EXAMPLE_USER}
    >
      Successfully logged in! Welcome aboard, {EXAMPLE_USER.name}!
    </LoggedInBanner>
    
  );
}

export default App;
```

- Now you have two different components, that occupy different parts of the spectrum.
- `Banner`, is the primitive, and `LoggedInBanner` is the one with business logic.

![Spectrum](images/image-25.png)

- Benefits, you have these two differ components you can use depending on which banner is most appropriate.
- The real benefit, is the structure of your application.
- The problem is, when you cram all the logic in the low level component, it's impossible to maintain or follow. Early returns, conditions, etc.
- And every time the product changed, a new requirement, you end up cramming all that logic into one area of the app. Cannot tell what that part of the app is rendering.

- When you restructure it, it becomes very clear what each component does and renders.
- üì£ And as the product changes and scales, you can solve that by creating new components.
- The cool thing, is all the new components you are spinning off, all use the same underlying banner.

### Exercises

#### Product Details Page

Imagine you are building nan e-commerce site. You have received a mockup, and we implemented as one big component.

In terms of our spectrum of abstraction, we have created a very high  level component, but there are two lower level components hiding within. Begging to be extracted into their own components.

Your mission (is you choose it) is to identify a spectrum related problem and to extract at least 1 lower level component.

- AC's
  - Extract at least 1 lower-level, potentially-reusable component.
  - The extracted component can be defined inside `/ProductDetails.js`, below the main component.
  - If you are not sure where to start / which components should be extracted, I provide my suggestions below the sandbox.

üë©‚Äçüíª Code Sandbox - [Product Details Page](https://codesandbox.io/s/rp4htb?file=/ProductDetails.js&utm_medium=sandpack)

- Attempted to extract the `buttons`, within the photo carousel. And create a new component called `PhotoButtons`.
- Passing in as props, product, and the state, `selectedPhotoIndex` and `setSelectedPhotoIndex`

```JAVASCRIPT
// My attempt to abstract the photos button. 
function PhotoButtons({ product, selectedPhotoIndex, setSelectedPhotoIndex }) {
  return (
          <div className="buttons">
            {product.photos.map((photoSrc, index) => {
              const isSelected = selectedPhotoIndex === index;
  
              return (
                <button
                  key={index}
                  className="thumbnail-button"
                  onClick={() => setSelectedPhotoIndex(index)}
                >
                  <VisuallyHidden>
                    Toggle image #{index + 1}
                  </VisuallyHidden>
                  <img alt="" src={photoSrc} />
                  <span
                    className="selected-ring"
                    style={{
                      opacity: isSelected ? 1 : 0,
                    }}
                  />
                </button>
              );
            })}
          </div>  
  )
}
```

- Solution: Try and do the star rating, because it's a low level component with a bunch of logic in it.
- Pass in the `product` as a prop.

```JAVASCRIPT
// Star rating
function StarRating({ product }) {
  return (
        <div className="star-rating">
          {range(5).map((num) => {
            const className =
              product.rating > num
                ? 'star filled'
                : 'star hollow';
            return <Star className={className} />;
          })}
        </div>
  )
}
```

- You can take this a step further, by updating the prop name, to `rating`, and just pass in the product.rating to make it clear you are only using a single object.

```JAVASCRIPT
function ProductDetails({ product }) {
    return (
        <StarRating 
          rating={product.rating}
        />
        // rest of component code
    )
}
// Star rating component
function StarRating({ rating }) {
  return (
        <div className="star-rating">
          {range(5).map((num) => {
            const className =
              rating > num
                ? 'star filled'
                : 'star hollow';
            return <Star className={className} />;
          })}
        </div>
  )
}
```

- Another thing you can pull out, is the photo toggle functionality.
- And move the state, inside that component, since it's not used anywhere else.

```JAVASCRIPT
function PhotoToggle({ photos }) {
  // move the state, inside the photos toggle
    const [
    selectedPhotoIndex,
    setSelectedPhotoIndex,
  ] = React.useState(0);
  
  return (
      <div>
          <img
            className="primary-photo"
            alt=""
            src={photos[selectedPhotoIndex]}
          />        
          <div className="buttons">
            {photos.map((photoSrc, index) => {
              const isSelected = selectedPhotoIndex === index;
  
              return (
                <button
                  key={index}
                  className="thumbnail-button"
                  onClick={() => setSelectedPhotoIndex(index)}
                >
                  <VisuallyHidden>
                    Toggle image #{index + 1}
                  </VisuallyHidden>
                  <img alt="" src={photoSrc} />
                  <span
                    className="selected-ring"
                    style={{
                      opacity: isSelected ? 1 : 0,
                    }}
                  />
                </button>
              );
            })}
          </div>  
      </div>
  )
}
```

- Then take a look at the higher level component, much easier to see what is going on.
- In the props, you can see at a high level, what the data structure each component uses.

```JAVASCRIPT
// Uses the low level components, StarRating and PhotoToggle defined above. 
function ProductDetails({ product }) {

  return (
    <article className="product-details">
      <div className="photos-wrapper">
        <div>
          <PhotoToggle 
            photos={product.photos}
          />
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="product-info">
        <h1>{product.title}</h1>
        <StarRating 
          rating={product.rating} 
        />
        <p className="product-description">
          {product.description}
        </p>
      </div>
    </article>
  );
}
```

            alt=""

                  className="thumbnail-button"
                  onClick={() => setSelectedPhotoIndex(index)}

                    Toggle image #{index + 1}
                  </VisuallyHidden>
                  <img alt="" src={photoSrc} />
                  <span
                    className="selected-ring"
                    style={{
                      opacity: isSelected ? 1 : 0,
                    }}
                  />
                </button>
              );
            })}
          </div>  
      </div>
  )
}

export default ProductDetails;
```

#### Extracting a Card Component

In the sandbox below, we have two separate components that each implement a similar 'card' design. Let's extract into it's own `Card` component.

- üë©‚Äçüíª Code sandbox - [Card Component](https://codesandbox.io/s/xrdbfl?file=/App.js&utm_medium=sandpack)

AC's

- Two files, `Card.js` and `Card.module.css`, have been created. Your mission is to populate them with the component + styles.
- You should use this component within `UserProfileCard` and `ProductInfoCard`.
- Note that the two cards have slightly differ styles: they have a different `box-shadow` value. Each card should be able to specify the elevation level for the shadow, to be applied dynamically inside `Card`.

- Create a `Card` component, with a `children` prop so you can use it in the other components `UserProfileCard` and `ProductInfoCard`

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';

import styles from './Card.module.css';

function Card({ children }) {
  /* TODO */
  return (
    <div className={styles.card}>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Card;
```

- Make sure you bring over the base `.card` styles into your CSS module `Card.module.css`

```CSS
.card {
  background: white;
  padding: 16px;
  border-radius: 8px;
}
```

- Now you need to account for the different elevations within the CSS global variables, `var(--elevation-1)`, `var(--elevation-2)`, `var(--elevation-3)`.

- Add an `elevation` prop to your `Card` component
- Create a boxShadow variable, and interpolate the CSS variable using the value of the prop `elevation`
- And add it to the DOM element via the `style` attribute.

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';

import styles from './Card.module.css';

function Card({ 
  elevation = 2, // values 1 | 2 | 3
  children,
}) {
  /* TODO */
  // Create a style for the elevation prop, and interpolate into a string using the CSS variable
  const boxShadow = `var(--elevation-${elevation})`;
  return (
    <div className={styles.card} style={{ boxShadow }}>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Card;
```

- Then, on your other components, import and then wrap with `Card` component. You can just pass in the elevation value you want, 1, 2, or 3.

```JAVASCRIPT
function UserProfileCard({ user }) {
  const profileUrl = `/users/${user.handle}`;
  const imageAlt = `${user.avatarDescription} (user profile photo)`;

  return (
    <>
    <Card elevation={1}>
      <img
        className={styles.avatar}
        alt={imageAlt}
        src={user.avatarSrc}
      />
      <a
        href={profileUrl}
        className={styles.userProfileLink}
      >
        {user.name}
      </a>
    </Card>
      
    </>
  );
}

export default UserProfileCard;
```

### Component Libraries

- A component library is a collection of low-level generic components. The LEGO bricks that every application needs. Things like buttons, date pickers and auto-pickers.

- This is mostly third-party component libraries. The most popular being Material UI.

- Josh doesn't recommend using these sorts of tools in most cases. Can be useful for prototyping, internal tools, but not well suited for production applications.

- Why not? Check out the blog post on the subject. [You don't need a UI framework.](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/05/you-dont-need-ui-framework/)

- The most critical part, very few tech companies actually rely on these tools. If your goal is to become a better React developer, you will need to know how to build applications without relying on these tools.

- Most tech companies build their own first-party component libraries. At DigitalOcean, built [Walrus](https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/introducing-walrus-digitaloceans-reimagined-design), at Khan Academy, built [Wonder Blocks](https://khan.github.io/wonder-blocks/?path=/docs/overview--docs)

#### Usability and Accessibility

Tools that focus exclusively on usability and accessibility without prescribing a bunch fo styles.

- [Reach UI](https://reach.tech)
- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com)
- [Radix Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com)
- [React ARIA](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/)

Other mentions:

- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com)
- Tailwind

#### Design Systems

To understand why very few product-focused companies use third party component libraries. We need to talk about design systems.

- A design system is what gives a brand its unique identity. It is a collection of rules that govern how a product loos, feels and behaves. It includes tokens for colors, typography styles, and in-depth designs for specific UI elements.

- Design systems are built by designers using design software, like Figma or Sketch. They provide the documents to developers to implement components based on their designs.

- In terms of an analogy, the design system is like a recipe book. The component library is the set of prepared ingredients required, chopped onions, tomatoes and mushrooms. And the web application is the finished meal.

- **Here is the problem**, third party component libraries have their own design system baked in.

- Material UI for example, uses Google's 'Material Design' system. It's a very specific aesthetic, used by official Google applications across the web and Android.

- Now, third-party component libraries do allow us to customize/tweak the styles, but it would be incredibly difficult and annoying to try and swap out an  entire design system this way. Developers who have done this, have regretted it.

- üì£ the bottom line: very few tech companies rely on 'pre-styled' component libraries like Material UI, because they want complete control over the branding / aesthetic.

#### Application Structure

When building a first-party component library, it's common for the component library to be its own project. It has its own git repository, its own landing page, and its own documentation.

- This is useful when our components need to be shared across multiple projects, but honesty, it adds a ton of friction.
- Josh's practice, is to keep all the components, from the entire spectrum, in a single directory.
- For example; the components from this course platform.

![components](images/image-27.png)

- Components with a single purple asterisk *, lowest-level components.
- Moving up the spectrum, components marked with **, higher level components, like `AccountDropDown`
- Finally, high-level components marked with, ***, things like `AccountPage` which renders all the main content of the Account Page.

- Good way to work, it's a spectrum and all the components are at your finger tips.

- Also, some directories have multiple components, for example the `Account Page`.
- Allow you to keep all the related content together.
- Here, the `MyAccountInfo` component will never be used outside of `AccountPage` component, and so it doesn't make sense to clutter up my `/src/components` directory.

![source directory](images/image-28.png)

## Prop Delegation

In teh `Banner` example from the Spectrum lesson, we saw how our `LoggedIn` banner had to "forward" some props along:

```JAVASCRIPT
function LoggedInBanner({
  user,
  // These two props:
  type,
  children,
}) {
  if (
    !user ||
    user.registrationStatus === 'unverified'
  ) {
    return null;
  }

  // ...are forwarded along to Banner:
  return <Banner type={type}>{children}</Banner>;
}
```

- ü§î What if the component had 10 forwarded props instead of 2? We would have to list them all out, one by one?
- React has a solution for that, instead we can take advantage of rest parameters and spread syntax
  - [JS Primer: Rest and Spread](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/joy-of-react/10-javascript-primer/12-rest-spread)

- Here is what it looks like:

```JAVASCRIPT
function LoggedInBanner({
  user,
  // Collect all unspecified props:
  ...delegated
}) {
  if (
    !user ||
    user.registrationStatus === 'unverified'
  ) {
    return null;
  }

  // And pass them onto Banner:
  return <Banner {...delegated} />
}
```

- Chosen the name `delegated` ebcause it feels symantically appropriate, but we can name this variable whatever we want, some prefer `rest`:

- If you `console.log` the `delegated` variable, we see an object containing all of the other props provided to this component. For example:

```JAVASCRIPT
console.log(delegated);
/*
  {
    type: 'success',
    children: 'Account registered!',
  }
*/
```

- To apply these props onto our `Banner` element, we create an expression slot with curly brackets, and spread the props along using the spread syntax `...`:

```JAVASCRIPT
// This code: 
<Banner {...delegated} />

// ...is equivalent to this code: 
<Banner
    type={delegated.type}
    children={delegated.children}
/>

// ...which is the same thing as this code:
<Banner type={delegated.type}>
  {delegated.children}

```

- To go one step further in demystifying this new syntax, here's hwo it gets transpiled to plain JS:

```JAVASCRIPT
// This JSX...
<UserProfileCard user={currentUser} {...delegated} />

// ...turns into this JavaScript:
React.createElement(
  UserProfileCard,
  {
    user: currentUser,
    ...delegated
  }
);
```

- üõë One gatcha, the `...delegated` item needs to be the final item in the list. And cannot have a trailing comma, you will get an error.

```JAVASCRIPT
function Slider({
  label,
  ...delegated, // <-- This comma is a problem
}) {}
```

### Supercharged HTML tags

- Imagine you have a component, that is a text input.

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';

function TextInput({ 
    id, 
    label, 
    type,
    value,
    onChange,
}) {
  const generatedId = React.useId();
  const appliedId = id || generatedId;
  
  return (
    <div className="text-input">
      <label htmlFor={appliedId}>
        {label}
      </label>
      <input
        id={appliedId}
        type={type}
        value={value}
        onChange={onChange}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default TextInput;
```

- You only have access to the things you exposed via props.
- You cannot provide, whatever attribute you would normally put on a text input, `required={true}` or a `minLength={12}` for example.
- React will not recognize those attributes if not provided via props. React has no idea that a component is supposed to be a wrapper around your `input` field
- All React knows, is we created a component, and it returns some JSX.
- And given them `props`, to work with.

- üì£ If you want your component `TextInput`, to work with attributes of the `input`, you have to use the prop delegation trick.

- If you have a bunch of props, you can combine them into a `...delegated` object

```JAVASCRIPT
function TextInput({ id, label, ...delegated }) {
    return (
        // JSX here...
    )
}
```

- Then in your JSX, spread the delegated object onto your element, this case the `input` field.
- üÜí You can choose where to put your `...delegated` props, can go on any element, and be passed in.

```JAVASCRIPT
// TextInput.js
import React from 'react';

function TextInput({ id, label, ...delegated }) {
  const generatedId = React.useId();
  const appliedId = id || generatedId;
  
  return (
    <div className="text-input">
      <label htmlFor={appliedId}>
        {label}
      </label>
      <input
        id={appliedId}
        // spread the ...delegated props
        {...delegated}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default TextInput;
```

- When you use the component, you can add a bunch of props, and passing into the component.
- All of the stuff you specify in the `input` is automatically being delegated along.

```JAVASCRIPT
    <TextInput
      required={true}
      data-test-id="login-email-field"
      label="Email"
      type="email"
      value={email}
      onChange={(event) => {
        setEmail(event.target.value);
      }}
    />
```

- Full component: [LogIn Form, Delegated](https://codesandbox.io/s/ckz6pc?file=/LoginForm.js&utm_medium=sandpack)

```JAVASCRIPT
// LogIn form...adding a bunch of properties to the TextInput
import React from 'react';

import TextInput from './TextInput';

function LoginForm() {
  const [email, setEmail] = React.useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = React.useState('');

  function handleLogin() {
    alert(`Logged in with ${email}`);
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleLogin}>
      <TextInput
        required={true}
        data-test-id="login-email-field"
        label="Email"
        type="email"
        value={email}
        onChange={(event) => {
          setEmail(event.target.value);
        }}
      />
      <TextInput
        required={true}
        minLength={12}
        label="Password"
        type="password"
        value={password}
        onChange={(event) => {
          setPassword(event.target.value);
        }}
      />
      <button>
        Submit
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default LoginForm;
```

### Exercises, Prop Delegation

Exercises for Prop Delegation

#### A Slider Component

- In the [sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/f6m2ku?file=/Slider.js&utm_medium=sandpack), you have a `Slider` component.

- Internally, this component renders an `<input type"range">` the built-in DOM neod for creating ranges and sliders. And so we can think of thi s`Slider` component as a "supercharged" range input.

- Unfortunately, we've only exposed a subset of attributes we might wish to set on this DOM node through props.
- Your mission is to forward all props on to the input, so that we can treat `<Slider>` as a supercharged range input.

**ACs**

- The `Slider` component should use the prop delegation technique to forward all unspecified props to the `<input type="range">` that renders.

- Add the `...delegated` rest parameter to your component as a prop.
- And then spread that onto your element in the JSX, the `<input>` slider.

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';

import styles from './Slider.module.css';

// add the ...delegated rest parameter
function Slider({ label, ...delegated }) {
  const id = React.useId();
  
  return (
    <div className={styles.wrapper}>
      <label
        htmlFor={id}
        className={styles.label}
      >
        {label}
      </label>
      <input
        type="range"
        id={id}
        className={styles.slider}
        // spread that onto the input
        {...delegated}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default Slider;
```

#### A Toggle Component

- Toggle components are similar to checkboxes. They are often used to flip a value on or off.
- We have a custom `Toggle` component, like this:

![Toggle](images/image-29.png)

- We want to be abe to pass a custom `className` to provide custom styles. For example, passing a CSS class that updates the color of the toggle circle.

![Toggle Circle](images/image-30.png)

- Your mission is to update the `Toggle` component so that it can be customized, by passing a `className`. It should also support additional custom props, like data attributes.

**ACs**

- In the example below, the second `<Toggle>` instance has a prop: `className="green-toggle`. This class should be applied o the `<button>` inside the `Toggle` component, producing the green circle shown in the GIF above.
- Other props (eg. data attributes) should also be forwarded along to the `<button>` element.
