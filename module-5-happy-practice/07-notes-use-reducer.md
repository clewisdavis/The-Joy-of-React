## useReducer

useReducer, is an alternative to manage state, a way to manage global state. In this course, using mostly `useState` hook and the `useReducer` hook. Both allow you to update and manage state variables.

The big difference with `useReducer`, two ideas:

- The actions that fire our application, like a user adding a new todo, or marking a todo as completed.
- The state-updating logic that runs when an action occurs.

You can build production application without using the `useReducer` hook.
One drawback is it requires a lot of scaffolding, and hoops to jump through.
The benefit, is it forces you to group all state-updating logic together.
