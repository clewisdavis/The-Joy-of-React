# The Joy of React - Module 2 - Course Notes

- [Course Outline Notes](course-notes.md)

## Working with State

- In the early days of the web, websites were basically fancy documents, we would load one HTML file, read the content and then load another one.

- The modern web is interactive. The app can respond to user actions in real time. Without the need to fetch the whole page.

- In this module:
  - How to respond to user actions with event binding.
  - How React manages the DOM for us, and what it means to re-render.
  - The `useState` hook and how to use it to build interactive components.
  - Understand the difference between props and state.
  - Working with forms in React.
  - Working with complex state, like objects and arrays.
  - Avoiding common pitfalls, state mutation.
  - How to share state across the application by lifting it up.

- Going from static websites to dynamic alive apps!

### Event Handlers

- When a user interacts with the page, hundreds of events are fired off in response. The browser is tracking every little thing you do.

- These events are important when building dynamic applications, we will listen for these events and use them to trigger state changes.
- When the use clicks on "X" button, we dismiss teh prompt, when user submits the form, we show a loading spinner.

- In order to respond to an event, we need to listen for it. JS already provides a built in way to do this, `addEventListener` method:

```JAVASCRIPT
const button = document.querySelector('.btn');

function doSomething() {
  // stuff here
}

button.addEventListener('click', doSomething);
```

- In the code above, we are listening for a specific event `click` targeting a specific element `btn`. We have a function to handle this event `doSomething`.
- When the user clicks on this particular button, your handler function will be invoked, allowing us to do something in response.

- The web platform offers another way to do this. We can embed our handler right in the HTML

```HTML
<button onclick="doSomething()">
  Click me!
</button>
```

- Rect piggybacks on this pattern, allowing us to pass an event handler right into the JSX:

```JAVASCRIPT
function App() {
  function doSomething() {
    // Stuff here
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={doSomething}>
      Click me!
    </button>
  )
}
```

- As with the `addEventListener`, this code will do the same thing: when use clicks on the button, the `doSomething` function is called.

- **This is the recommended way to handle events in React.**
- Try and use the "onX" props like `onClick` and `onChange` when possible.

- Few reasons why:
  - **Automatic cleanup:** When we use an event listener, we supposed to remove it when we are done, with `removeEventListener`. If we forget to do this, we introduce a memory leak. React automatically removes listeners when we use 'on X' handler functions.
  - **Improved performance:** React can optimize things for use, like batching multiple event listeners together to reduce the memory consumption.
  - **No DOM interaction:** Avoid interacting with the DOM directly.

- ‚ÑπÔ∏è One of the core ideas behind React, is that is does the DOM manipulation for you. Stay within React's abstraction rather than trying to compete with it to manage the DOM.

#### Differences from HTML, Events

- Looking at the `onChange` prop, it looks very similar tot he in HTML method of adding event handlers.

##### Camel Casing

- In JSX, you have to write `camelCased` attribute names in JSX.
- Be careful to write `onClick` instead of `onclick`. Other examples, `onChange`, `onKeyDown`, `onTransitionEnd` etc.
- If you forget, React will let you know.

##### Passing a function reference

- When working with event handlers in React, we need to pass a reference to the function. We don't call the function like we do in HTML:

```HTML
// ‚úÖ We want to do this:
<button onClick={doSomething} />

// üö´ Not this:
<button onClick={doSomething()} />
```

- When we include the parentheses, we invoke th function right away, the moment the React app is rendered. We want to give React a reference to the function, so React can call it at a later time, when the user clicks on the button.

#### Specifying Arguments

- Here is the thing, what if we want to specify an argument to a function?

- For example, if you wanted to make a function called `setTheme`, and we use it to change the user's color theme from Light Mode, to Dark Mode.

- To do this, we need to supply he name of the theme we are switching to, like this:

```JAVASCRIPT
// Switch to light mode:
setTheme('light');

// Switch to dark mode:
setTheme('dark');
```

- How can we do this? If we pass `setTheme` as a reference to the `onClick`, we can't supply arguments:

```JAVASCRIPT
// üö´ Invalid: calls the function without 'dark'
<button onClick={setTheme}>
  Toggle theme
</button>
```

- In order to specify the argument, we need to wrap it in a parentheses, but it gets called right away:

```JAVASCRIPT
// üö´ Invalid: calls the function right away
<button onClick={setTheme('dark')}>
  Toggle theme
</button>
```

- We can solve this problem with a wrapper function

```JAVASCRIPT
<button onClick={() => setTheme('dark')}>
  Toggle Theme
</button>
```

- We are creating a new anonymous arrow function, `() => setTheme('dark')` and passing it to React, to be called when the user clicks the button.

- When the button is clicked, the function is called and the code inside the function is executed: `setTheme('dark')`.

#### Exercises, Event Handlers

##### Click the ball, build a simple game

- The goal of the game is to click the ball, to show an alert when the ball is clicked:

- We can us the `window.alert()` to show the message.
- AC's
  - When the user click on the ball, a winning message should be shown.
  - You should handle 'click' events specifically, as this even is triggered on click, on tap, or even when a user focuses on teh element with the keyboard and hits "Enter" Key
    - If you don't use a pointer device, you can use the keyboard method to test your code.

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';

import VisuallyHidden from './VisuallyHidden';

function ClickBallGame() {
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <button
        className="ball"
      >
        <VisuallyHidden>
          Ball
        </VisuallyHidden>
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ClickBallGame;
```

- Solution:
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è You can write as a separate function, especially is you have multiple expressions inside your function.

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';

import VisuallyHidden from './VisuallyHidden';

function ClickBallGame() {
  function handleClick() {
    window.alert('You win');
  }
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <button
        className="ball"
        onClick={handleClick}
      >
        <VisuallyHidden>
          Ball
        </VisuallyHidden>
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ClickBallGame;
```

- You can also do this inline function, to achieve the same result.

```JAVASCRIPT
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <button
        className="ball"
        onClick={() => window.alert('You win')}
      >
        <VisuallyHidden>
          Ball
        </VisuallyHidden>
      </button>
    </div>
  );
```

##### Click the ball v2

- Now, in addition to the ball, it now has a bomb. If the bomb is clicked, we want to show a 'lose' message.
- The problem with the started code, clicking on either the item, the ball or bomb, it shows the 'lose' message.

- You mission, if you choose it, it to fix the code so that i throws the right message depending on which item is clicked.

- AC's
  - When the user clicks the ball, a winning message should be shown.
  - When the user clicks the bomb, a losing message should be shown.
  - The `handeClick` function should still be used, and you shouldn't have to change anything about the function itself.

```JAVASCRIPT
// STARTER CODE
import React from 'react';

import VisuallyHidden from './VisuallyHidden';

function ClickBallGame() {
  function handleClick(type) {
    if (type === 'win') {
      alert('You win!');
    } else {
      alert('You lose :(');
    }
  }
  
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <button
        className="ball"
        onClick={handleClick}
      >
        <VisuallyHidden>
          Ball
        </VisuallyHidden>
      </button>
      <button
        className="bomb"
        onClick={handleClick}
      >
        <span
          role="img"
          aria-label="bomb"
        >
          üí£
        </span>
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ClickBallGame;
```

- My solution:
- Put a wrapper function on the `onClick` and pass in the `type` parameter into the `handleClick()` function.

```JAVASCRIPT
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <button
        className="ball"
        onClick={() => handleClick('win')}
      >
        <VisuallyHidden>
          Ball
        </VisuallyHidden>
      </button>
      <button
        className="bomb"
        onClick={() => handleClick('lose')}
      >
        <span
          role="img"
          aria-label="bomb"
        >
          üí£
        </span>
      </button>
    </div>
  );
```

### The useState Hook

- Below is a common example of a minimal counter demo.
- Click on the button and watch the count increase:

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Value: {count}
    </button>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

- Break this down, what is going on here:
- Our goal is to keep track of the number of times the user has clicked the button.
- For dynamic values, we need to use React state.
- State is used for values that change over time.

- To create a state variable, we use the `useState` function.
- This function takes a single argument: the initial value. In this case, that value is `0`. The value is chosen because when the page first loads, we clicked the button 0 times.

- `useState` is a **hook**. A hook is a special type of function that allows us to 'hook into' React internals.

- The `useState` hook returns an array containing two items:

1. The current value of the state variable. We've decided to call it `count`, this can be whatever you want to name it.
2. A function we can use to update the state variable. We named it `setCount`. It's best practice to pre-pend the `set` to the function.

- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Destructing Assignment, below is the same thing as the above `const [count, setCount]` we are destructuring `count` and `setCount`.

```JAVASCRIPT
const countArray = React.useState(0);

const count = countArray[0];
const setCount = countArray[1];
```

- üëÄ Can check out the [Array Destructuring Primer Lesson](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/joy-of-react/10-javascript-primer/06-array-destructuring)

##### Naming Conventions

- When we create a state variable, we can name it whatever we want.
- However, it's best practice to follow the `x`, `setX` convention:

```JAVASCRIPT
const [user, setUser] = React.useState();
const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = React.useState();
const [flowerBouquet, setFlowerBouquet] = React.useState();
```

- `user` The first destructured variable si the name of the thing we are tracking.
- `setUser` The second variable prefixes that name with the `set`, specifying it's a function that can be called to change the thing. This is sometimes referred to as a "setter function", since it sets the new value of teh state variable.

- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Importing the hook?
  - Some tutorials write this code differently.
  - Import at the top of the page. `import React, { useState } from 'react';`
  - Instead of `React.useState`, you can import `useState` function at the top of the file and using it on it's own, `useState`.

##### Initial Value

- React state variables can be given an initial value:

```JAVASCRIPT
const [count, setCount] = React.useState(1);
console.log(count);
```

- We can also supply a function. React will call this function on the very first render to evaluate the initial value:

```JAVASCRIPT
const [count, setCount] = ReactuseState(() => {
  return 1 + 1;
});

console.log(count); // 2
```

- Calling a function can be useful to do an expensive operation to calculate the initial value. For example, reading from localStorage:

```JAVASCRIPT
const [count, setCount] = React.useState(() => {
  return window.localStorage.getItem('saved-count');
});
```

- The benefit here is that we are only doing the expensive work (redon from localStorage) once, on the initial render, rather than doing it on every single render.

- In a later lesson, discuss localStorage

- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Hold up, What's the difference between those two?

```JAVASCRIPT
// Form 1:
const [count, setCount] = React.useState(
  window.localStorage.getItem('saved-count')
);

// Form 2:
const [count, setCount] = React.useState(() => {
  return window.localStorage.getItem('saved-count');
});
```

- Helpful to forget about React for a moment and think in pure JS.

- Consider this function:

```JAVASCRIPT
function run() {
  console.log('Hello');
}
```

- When we call the `run` function, we will log the word "Hello", if I call the function 5 times, I get 5 "Hello" in the console.

- Tweak it:

```JAVASCRIPT
function run() {
  const sayHi = () => {
    console.log('Hello');
  };
}
```

- Now, when I call the `run` function, nothing is logged to the console. That's because the `console.log` is wrapped up in an inner function, `sayHi`.
- every time we call the `run` function, we are creating a brand new `sayHi` function, but never calling it.

#### Core React Loop

- We have seen, when we update the state variable by calling the setter function `setCount` the UI gets updated. But how does this actually work?

- This is the core of React, literally named for how it reacts to state changes.

- Let's use the counter as an example:

```JAVASCRIPT
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Value: {count}
    </button>
  )
}
```

- What is happening here exactly when the component is rendered for the first time?
- Our `Counter` function returns a bunch of JSX, Let's look at it in pure JS, so see what's going on.

```JAVASCRIPT
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  return React.createElement(
    'button',
    { onClick: () => setCount(count + 1) },
    'Value: ',
    count
  );
}
```

- When this code runs, `React.createElement` produces a React element, which is a plain JS object like this:

```JAVASCRIPT
{
  type: 'button',
  key: null,
  ref: null,
  props: {
    onClick: () => setCount(count + 1),
  },
  children: 'Value: 0',
  _owner: null,
  _store: { validated: false }
}
```

- As we learned before, React elements are essentially descriptions of the UI we want. Here we are saying we want a button that contains the text "Value: 0".
- We could visualize this JS object as the following HTML snippet:

```HTML
<button>
  Value: 0
</button>
```

- Our React element, that JS object, is describing teh DOM structure. React takes that description and turns it into a real thing.
- It creates a `<button>` DOM node and put on the page.

- I didn't show the `onClick` handler in this little sketch, but it's very much a part of this process. When react creates and injects the `<button>` DOM node, it attaches our handler function.

- **Let's think about what happens when the button is clicked.**
- The `setCount` function will be called and we will pass in a new value. `count` will be incremented from 0 to 1.

- **Whenever a state variable is updated, it triggers a re-render.**
- Once again, React will cal the `Counter` function.
- This creates a brand-new React element, a new description of the UI we want.

- The new react element describes this DOM structure:

```HTML
<button>
  Value: 1
</button>
```

- **Each render is like taking a snapshot.**
- We generate a description that shows what the UI should look like, based on the components props/state. Like a photo that captures what things were like at a moment in time.
- And React has two snapshots:

```HTML
<button>
  Value: 0
</button>
```

```HTML
<button>
  Value: 1
</button>
```

- The user clicked a button and this second snapshot was generated.
- React now has to figure out how to update the DOM, so that is matches this latest snapshot.
- It's like those puzzle games, where you have to figure out the differences between two images.
- React has to play this sort of game, looking for the changes between teh two snapshots.

- **This process is known as reconciliation.**
- React figures out what's changed and updates the UI.
- Once React figures out the difference, it will need to **commit** these changes. With precision, it updates teh DOM, taking care only to tweak the things hat need to be tweaked.

In our button case, the operation would be something like:

```JAVASCRIPT
button.innerText = "Value: 1";
```

- **This is the fundamental "flow" of React, the core loop.**
- The sequence is like:

- Mount
  - Trigger > Render > Commit

- Mount: When we render the component for the first time, there is no previous snapshot to compare it to. So, React will create al the necessary DOM nodes from scratch, and inject them into the page.

##### Rendering vs. Painting

- Like 3D software, when you take raw data and turn it into an image, like a 3D model in Blender.
- The term "render" generally refers to this sort of thing; we are taking some sort of unprocessed raw input, and generating a final ready to use output.

- Even in web frameworks, the definition is pretty consistent.

- In React, however the term "render" means something slightly different. I think so much of the confusion in React comes from this misunderstanding.

- In this example:

```JAVASCRIPT
function AgeLimit({ age }) {
  if (age < 18) {
    return (
      <p>You're not old enough!</p>
    );
  }

  return (
    <p>Hello, adult!</p>
  );
}
```

- Our `AgeLimit` component check an `age` prop and returns one of two paragraphs.
- Now, let's suppose we re-render this component, and wind up with the following before/after pair of snapshots:

```JAVASCRIPT
age: 16

{
  type: 'p',
  key: null,
  ref: null,
  props: {},
  children: "You're not old enough!",
}
```

```JAVASCRIPT
age: 17

{
  type: 'p',
  key: null,
  ref: null,
  props: {},
  children: "You're not old enough!",
}
```

- In both cases, `age` is less than 18, and so we wind up with teh exact same UI.
- As a result, *no DOM mutation* happens at all.

- When we talk about 're-rendering', we are saying to check it anything's changed.
- üí° If we spot a difference between snapshots, React will need to update the DOM, but it will be a precisely-targeted minimal change. üí°

- When React does change a part of the DOM, teh browser will need to re-paint. A re-paint is when the pixels on the screen are re-drawn because a part of the DOM was mutated.

- This is done natively by the browser when teh DOM is edited with JS, whether by React, Angular, jQuery, vanilla JS, etc.

To Summarize: üöÄ React Re-Rendering

- A **re-render** is a React process where we figure out what needs to change, AKA reconciliation, to spot the difference between snapshots.

- If something has changed between eh two snapshots, React will "commit" those changes by deleting the DOM, so that it matches the latest snapshot.

- Whenever a SOM node is edited, the browser will re-paint, re-drawing the relevant pixel so that the user sees the correct UI.

- **No all re-renders require re-paints!** If nothing has changed between snapshots, React won't edit any DOM nodes, and nothing will be re-painted.

- üëÄ The critical thing to understand si that when we talk about re-rendering, we are not saying that we should throw away the current UI and re-build everything from scratch.

- React ties to keep the re-painting to a minimum, because re-painting is slow. Instead of generating a bunch of new DOM notes from scratch (lots of painting), it figures out what's changed between snapshots and make the required tweaks with surgical precision.

- For more in-depth; see react docs [Render and Commit](https://react.dev/learn/render-and-commit)

#### Asynchronous Updates

- Consider the following code: What value would you expect to see in the developer console when the user clicks the button for the first time?

```JAVASCRIPT
function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <p>
        You've clicked {count} times.
      </p>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setCount(count + 1);
          console.log(count)
        }}
      >
        Click me!
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

- The answer is 0, I guessed 1, what is going on here?

- When we create our state variable, we initialize ti to `0`. Then, when we click the button, we increment it by 1, to `1`. So shouldn't it log `1` and not `0`?

- Here is the catch: **state setters are not immediate.**

- When we call `setCount` we tell Rect that we would like to request a change to a state variable.
- React does not immediately drop everything; it waits until the current operation is completed (processing the click), and then updates the value and triggers a re-render.

- For now, the thing to remember is that **updating a state variable is asynchronous**. It affects what the state will be for the **next render**. It's a scheduled update.

- Here is how to fix the code, so that we have access to the new value right away:

```JAVASCRIPT
function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <p>
       You clicked {count} times.
      </p>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          const nextCount = count + 1;
          setCount(nextCount);
          console.log(nextCount)
        }}
      >
        Click me!
      </button>
    </>
  )
}
```

- We store the updated value in a variable, so that we can access that variable whenever we want to know what the new value is.

- I like to use prefix `next`, since it conveys that we are talking about the 'future' value of the state, what it will be on the next render. But you can name whatever you want.
- Try and fix the bug:

#### Exercises, useState Hook, Role Playing Game

- You are building an in-browser role playing game, but we have a bug. The wrong values are being shown to the user when the character levels up.

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';

function Character() {
  const [strength, setStrength] = React.useState(6);
  const [dexterity, setDexterity] = React.useState(9);
  const [intelligence, setIntelligence] = React.useState(15);

  function triggerLevelUp() {
    setStrength(strength + 1);
    setDexterity(dexterity + 2);
    setIntelligence(intelligence + 3);

    window.alert(`
      Congratulations! Your hero now has the following stats:
      Str: ${strength}
      Dex: ${dexterity}
      Int: ${intelligence}
    `);
  }

  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <img
        alt="8-bit wizard character"
        src="https://sandpack-bundler.vercel.app/img/mage-sprite.gif"
      />
      <button onClick={triggerLevelUp}>
        Level Up
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Character;
```

- My solution: To declare variables for the values so they update right away:
- What is going on with this code?
- Why are we seeing stale values when you click on the 'Level Up' button?
- It's not actually changing the variable as you would expect, `strength = strength + 1`
- The way the `triggerLevelUp()` function works in state, is they schedule an update.
- It's a way to tell React, hey we are changing some stuff, increase this value by 1.
- So please, re-render with this new value.
- Telling React to redo all the work that it has already done, to determine what the UI is.
- And on the next pass, next render, it should use the new values.
- When React sees `setStrength(strength + 1);`, React makes a "calendar appointment" but *it doesn't interrupt what it is already doing*, running through the function.
- **It's going to go through the rest of the function, without changing anything.**

- And the next time we run the function `Character`, the new values will be populated.

```JAVASCRIPT
function Character() {
  const [strength, setStrength] = React.useState(6);
  const [dexterity, setDexterity] = React.useState(9);
  const [intelligence, setIntelligence] = React.useState(15);

  function triggerLevelUp() {
    const nextStrength = strength + 1;
    const nextDexterity = dexterity + 2;
    const nextIntelligence = intelligence + 3;
    
    setStrength(nextStrength);
    setDexterity(nextDexterity);
    setIntelligence(nextIntelligence);

    window.alert(`
      Congratulations! Your hero now has the following stats:
      Str: ${nextStrength}
      Dex: ${nextDexterity}
      Int: ${nextIntelligence}
    `);
  }
```

#### Exercise, Counter 2.0

- The buttons have already been added to the page, but they don't do anything yet. The task is to wire up the buttons with the following ACs.

ACs:

- The up arrow button should increase the count by 1.
- The double arrow up button should increase the count by 10.
- The refresh button should reset the count to 0.
- The pound button should set the count to a random number between 1 and 100.
- The double down arrow button should decrease the count by 10.
- The down arrow button should decrease the count by 1.

- Starter code:

```JAVASCRIPT
import { ChevronUp, ChevronsUp, ChevronDown, ChevronsDown, RotateCcw, Hash } from 'react-feather'

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <p>
        <span>Current value:</span>
        <span className="count">
          {count}
        </span>
      </p>
      <div className="button-row">
        <button>
          <ChevronUp />
          <span className="visually-hidden">
            Increase slightly
          </span>
        </button>
        <button>
          <ChevronsUp />
          <span className="visually-hidden">
            Increase a lot
          </span>
        </button>
        <button>
          <RotateCcw />
          <span className="visually-hidden">
            Reset
          </span>
        </button>
        <button>
          <Hash />
          <span className="visually-hidden">
            Set to random value
          </span>
        </button>
        <button>
          <ChevronsDown />
          <span className="visually-hidden">

          </span>
        </button>
        <button>
          <ChevronDown />
          <span className="visually-hidden">
            Decrease slightly
          </span>
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

- The solution: use the `setCount` **state setter function** to increase and decrease.

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';
import { ChevronUp, ChevronsUp, ChevronDown, ChevronsDown, RotateCcw, Hash } from 'react-feather'

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <p>
        <span>Current value:</span>
        <span className="count">
          {count}
        </span>
      </p>
      <div className="button-row">
        <button
          // Increase by 1
          onClick={
            () => setCount(count + 1)
          }
        >
          <ChevronUp />
          <span className="visually-hidden">
            Increase slightly
          </span>
        </button>
        <button 
          // Increase by 10
          onClick={
            () => setCount(count + 10)
          }
        >
          <ChevronsUp />
          <span className="visually-hidden">
            Increase a lot
          </span>
        </button>
        <button
          onClick={
            () => setCount(0)
          }
        >
          <RotateCcw />
          <span className="visually-hidden">
            Reset
          </span>
        </button>
        <button
          // set random value
          onClick={
            () => setCount(Math.ceil(Math.random() * 100))
          }
        >
          <Hash />
          <span className="visually-hidden">
            Set to random value
          </span>
        </button>
        <button
          //decrease by 10
          onClick={
            () => setCount(count - 10)
          }
        >
          <ChevronsDown />
          <span className="visually-hidden">
            Decrease a lot
          </span>
        </button>
        <button
          // decrease by 1
          onClick={
            () => setCount(count - 1)
          }
        >
          <ChevronDown />
          <span className="visually-hidden">
            Decrease slightly
          </span>
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

#### Why the dance?

- Why so much to manage state management in React?
- React is based on the confines of JavaScript.
- JS doesn't give us a way to observe variables.
- We need to know, when a variable changes in order for React to trigger a re-render.
- I our counter example, the only way for the UI to update, is for all the code to re-run. It doesn't automatically re-run the code when you change a variable.

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Value: {count}
    </button>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

- How do you get the increment, if you try in plain JS. You can't, it doesn't persist across function calls.

```JAVASCRIPT
function helloWorld() {
  let count = 0;
  count = count + 1;
}

helloWorld(); // 1
helloWorld(); // 1
helloWorld(); // 1
helloWorld(); // 1
```

- every time you call that function, you get the same results, it doesn't increment. We re-initialize the variable and increment by one.
- The increment `count + 1` doesn't persist across function calls. JS doesn't give us a way to thread values through function calls.

- Back to React, **Components in React are Functions in JS.**
- If you think through what the `Counter()` function above does.

```JAVASCRIPT
// Start you app
ReactDOM.render(<App />)
// Transpile to
ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(App))
// Calling this function, get an JS object with all the stuff
{ type: App, props {}}
// The point is, React is going to evoke the App() function
// Re-render
App()
// Re-render
App()
// Re-render
App()
// Re-render
App()

```

- The point is, React is going to evoke the `App()` function, every time we trigger a re-render.
- every time you re-render, it's like a timeline, a snapshot of that component.
- The variable needs to be defined within the component, so every instance can have it's own dynamic state.

- React exist in the confines of JS, and if we define a variable within a component/function, then that variable will be re-initialized every time we call the function.

```JAVASCRIPT
function App() {
  let count = 0;
  return {
    <p>{count}</p>
  }
}
```

- Back to `React.useState(0);`, we need to have some way, to access the current value of count, without redefining it in every function call.
- The `React.useState()` function is reaching into React, and pulling out the state variable.
- On the very first render, we are giving React the value, `const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);` and putting it into the `count` variable.
- On the second render, we are reaching in and getting the new value.
- And so on, we are pulling the value out of React, which exist outside the scope of the function.

- The `setCount` function, JS doesn't give us a way to observe values, so we need to tell React it's time to render.
- The `setCount` is doing two things:
  - Primary thing, we are changing the value, and scheduling the update, so when we re-render the function, the `count` variable will have the new value.
  - Secondary thing, we are also signaling to React it's time to re-render.

- The easiest way to think about React, is a series of snapshots over time.
- When you first call a component, `App()` you get an initial value.
- Then every time you call the component after that, you get another snapshot and on and one.
- For each of these snapshot, the `state` variable is being populated within React.

- React doesn't compile to some other language, it is always restricted by the rules of JS.

### Forms

- Everyone's favorite thing to build, you know, the worlds most popular website, is just one form.
- Lots of packages claiming to solve all the form problems, but forms are not that bad to build in React.

#### Data Binding

- When building we apps, we want to sync a bit of state to a particular form input.
- For example, a 'username' field should be bound to the value of a `username` state variable.

- This is commonly known as 'data binding'. Most front end frameworks offer a way to bind a particular bit of state to a particular form control.
- Here is what it typically looks like in React.

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';

function SearchForm() {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState('dogs');
  
  return (
    <>
      <form>
        <label htmlFor="search-input">
          Search:
        </label>
        <input
          type="text"
          id="search-input"
          value={searchTerm}
          onChange={(event) => {
            setSearchTerm(event.target.value);
          }}
        />
      </form>
      <p>
        Search term: {searchTerm}
      </p>
    </>
  );
}

export default SearchForm;
```

- What's going on above?
- If you start without the `value` or `onChange` you have an uncontrolled element.
- Uncontrolled Element, React creates the element, puts it on the page but after that, React doesn't know what we are doing with it.

- If you want to bind the input so that it always holds the value in state variable, `searchTerm`, you have to do a few things.
- First, you have to set the `value` property, `value="hello"`

```JAVASCRIPT
        <input
          type="text"
          id="search-input"
          value="hello"
        />
```

- However, notice you cannot change the value in the field, React is restricting you from updating.
- The reason, value servers as a form of lock, once you set the value, that input is always **bound** to that value.
- Now, we are going to add the expression slot, `value={searchTerm}`, but notice you still cannot change it.

```JAVASCRIPT
        <input
          type="text"
          id="search-input"
          value={searchTerm}
        />
```

- The input is still locked into whatever the value of the variable is, `searchTerm`.
- Why? This is because we haven't called the state function, `setSearchTerm`.

- Data binding example, set up an `onClick` button, to update the value of the state variable, `searchTerm`

```JAVASCRIPT
  return (
    <>
      <form>
        <label htmlFor="search-input">
          Search:
        </label>
        <input
          type="text"
          id="search-input"
          value={searchTerm}
        />
      </form>
      <p>
        Search term: {searchTerm}
      </p>

      <button
        onClick={() => setSearchTerm(Math.random())}
      >Click Me</button>
    </>
  );
```

- Now, when you click the button, the state variable updates and you can see the new value in the search input.
- But this is only **one way data binding**. Half of the equation.
- To set up **two way data binding**, you also want to update the value of state variable when you update the value of the search input.
- To do that, you have to add a `onChange` listener on the input.

```JAVASCRIPT
        <input
          type="text"
          id="search-input"
          value={searchTerm}
          onChange={(event) => {
            console.log(event);
          }}
        />
```

- And pass in the `event`, in JS, an event is an object that describes the change that just happened. For example, if you type in an input, the `change` event, describes that change.

- When you console log the event, you get back and object, the thing to pay attention to, is the `target`. Then you can get access to all the attributes of that `target`.
- For example; `console.log(event.target.value)`

```JAVASCRIPT
        <input
          type="text"
          id="search-input"
          value={searchTerm}
          onChange={(event) => {
            console.log(event.target.value);
          }}
        />
```

- Now when you type in the field, you see characters you are typing in.
- ü§î But why isn't it showing in the field, and only logging in the console?
- React is allowing the `onChange` to fire, but as soon as it finishes firing the `onChange` event, React makes sure the value remains locked into what the value of `searchTerm` is.
- It happens so fast, **inbetween paint cycles**, you don't see it in render, but for brief moment, the value is updated and then React sets it back.

- Now, we can correct this by calling the `setSearchTerm` state function when the user types in the input search box.
- And going to call it with the `event.target.value`.

```JAVASCRIPT
        <input
          type="text"
          id="search-input"
          value={searchTerm}
          onChange={(event) => {
            setSearchTerm(event.target.value);
          }}
        />
```

- In other words, I type in the text box, the event fires, it references the element that triggered the event, and that shows the value the user just entered.
- And because you are updating the state variable `searchTerm`, and react locks it down, you have updated the `value={searchTerm}` to what the user put in the field.

- The shown value of the input, will always be in sync with whatever the `searchTerm` variable holds.

- Do you actually have to bind the value? Two way data binding, if you remove the `value` on the input, you loose two way data binding.
- If the state changes by some other way, say a button, the state variable will change, but it gets out of sync with what is shown in the input.

#### Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Inputs

- When we set the `value` attribute ona form control, we tell React that it should be a **controlled element**.
- In React, this means React is managing the input.

- If we don't set the `value`, the input is an **uncontrolled element**. This means React doesn't do any management.

- The golden rule: **An element should always be either a controlled or uncontrolled element.**
- This can lead to a common issue, like the following:

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';

function SignupForm() {
  // No default value:
  const [username, setUsername] = React.useState();
  
  return (
    <form>
      <label htmlFor="username">
        Select a username:
      </label>
      <input
        type="text"
        id="username"
        value={username}
        onChange={event => {
          setUsername(event.target.value);
        }}
      />
    </form>
  );
}

export default SignupForm;
```

- If you try typing into the input, you can an error in the console.
- `Warning: A component is changing an uncontrolled input to be controlled.`
- Why is this happening? We are setting the `value={username}`.
- **Here is the problem:** `username` is undefined at first, since there is not default value in the state hook. Here is what it's doing.

```JAVASCRIPT
const username = undefined;

<input
  type="text"
  id="username"
  value={username}
  onChange={event => {
    setUsername(event.target.value);
  }}
/>
```

- When we set `value` to `undefined`, the same as not setting it as all. react will treat the input as an **uncontrolled element**.
- When the user starts typing in the input, the `onChange` event updates the value of `username` from `undefined` to a string.
- And so, React flips the element to a controlled element, and throws the warning.

- **Here is how to solve the problem:** We always want to make sure we are passing a define `value`. You can do this by initializing `username` to an empty strong:

```JAVASCRIPT
// üö´ Incorrect. `username` will flip from `undefined` to a string:
const [username, setUsername] = React.useState();

// ‚úÖ Correct. `username` will always be a string:
const [username, setUsername] = React.useState('');
```

- With this change, our input is being controlled by React state from the very first render, since we are always passing a defined value.
- Even though empty strings are considered falsy they still count.

#### The onClick Parable

- In the context of a modern React application, this isn't usually what we want. We don't want to reload the entire page, we want to fetch a bit of data and re-render a few components with that data. This produces a faster, smoother user experience.

- A mistake most React dev's make, imagine this lesson, you are building a search form:

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';

function SearchForm({ runSearch }) {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState('');
  
  return (
    <div className="search-form">
      <input
        type="text"
        value={searchTerm}
        onChange={event => {
          setSearchTerm(event.target.value);
        }}
      />
      <button>
        Search!
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default SearchForm;
```

- In this example, `runSearch` is the function we want to call when the suer clicks on the Search button. In a real app, it would make s network request, and update some state with the results.

- Here is the question: how should we use this function?
- A lot of engineers will solve for this by adding an `onClick` handler to the submit button:

```JAVASCRIPT
<button onClick={() => runSearch(searchTerm)}>
  Search!
</button>
```

- There are a number ro problems with this approach.
- For example, what if the user tries to search by pressing "Enter" after typing in the text input?
- You could start to do down the path, and put an `onKeyDown` event listener?

```JAVASCRIPT
<input
  type="text"
  value={searchTerm}
  onChange={event => {
    setSearchTerm(event.target.value);
  }}
  onKeyDown={event => {
    if (event.key === 'Enter') {
      runSearch(searchTerm);
    }
  }}
/>
```

- **We are going down the wrong path here.** We are re-implementing stuff that the browser already knows how to do!

#### Use a Form

- The path you want to head down, to solve this problem, is to wrap your form controls in a `<form>` tag.

- Then, instead of listening for clicks and keys, we can listen for the **form submit event.**
- See how much simpler the code gets:

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';

function SearchForm({ runSearch }) {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState('');
  
  return (
    <form
      className="search-form"
      onSubmit={event => {
        event.preventDefault();
        runSearch(searchTerm);
      }}
    >
      <input
        type="text"
        value={searchTerm}
        onChange={event => {
          setSearchTerm(event.target.value);
        }}
      />
      <button>
        Search!
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default SearchForm;
```

- The form submit event will be called automatically when the suer clicks the button, or presses "Enter" whenever the input or button is focused.
- When that event fires, we will run our search.

- Instead of trying to re-create a bunch of standard web platform stuff, **we should use the platform native behavior** and let it solve these sorts of problems for us!

- By using a form submit event, we get to user client-side validation:

```JAVASCRIPT
<input
  type="password"
  required={true}
  minLength={8}
/>
```

#### Default form behavior

- One little quick with using `onSubmit`. We need to prevent teh default submission behavior:

```JAVASCRIPT
<form
  className="search-form"
  onSubmit={event => {
    event.preventDefault();
    runSearch(searchTerm);
  }}
>
```

- To understand why, remember back in the day, before `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest` and JSON.
- If you wanted to make a request to a server, like when fetching search results, you couldn't request only the data. You needed to request a whole new HTML file.
- The user would be redirected to a new URL, and the sever would render a template into an HTML doc, using the data sent with the request.

- **Forms still operate this way by default.** When you submit a form, the browser will try to send the user to the URL specified by the `action` attribute:

```HTML
<!--
  Submitting this form will redirect the user to the
  /search page, sending along the data collected from
  the form fields.
-->
<form
  method="POST"
  action="/search"
>
```

- If we omit the `action` attribute, the browser will use the current URL, effectively reloading the page.

- üëÄ**In the context of a modern Rect app, this isn't what we want. We do not want to reload the entire page, we want to fetch a bit of data and re-render a few components with that data. This produces a faster, smoother user experience.**üëÄ

- That's why we need to include `event.preventDefault()`. It stops the browser from executing a full page reload.

### Other Form Controls

- The web platform provides lots of additional form controls:
- Textareas
- Radio Buttons
- Checkboxes
- Selects
- Ranges
- Color pickers

- And are are a little different from one another, can be frustrating to work with.
- Take textarea for example, defines the value as children rather than a `value`

```HTML
<textarea>
  This is the current value
</textarea>
```

- Another example, the select tag uses a `selected` prop on one of the `<option>` children to signify the selected value:

```HTML
<select>
  <option value="a">
    Option 1
  </option>
  <option value="b" selected>
    Option 2
  </option>
  <option value="c">
    Option 3
  </option>
</select>
```

- Good news, React has tweaked many of these form controls so they have similar behavior. Lot less chaos with form controls in Rect.

- Essentially all form controls follow the same pattern:

1. The current value is tracked using either `value` (for most inputs) or `checked` (for checkboxes and radio).
2. We respond to changes with the `onChange` event listener.

#### Select Tag

- The `<select>` tag allows the user to select a single option form a list of predefined options.

- When working with select tags in React, they work pretty much exactly like text inputs. We use `value` and `onChange`. Example:

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  const [
    selectedOption,
    setSelectedOption
  ] = React.useState('red');

  return (
    <form>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>
          What is your favorite color?
        </legend>
        
        <select
          value={selectedOption}
          onChange={event => {
            setSelectedOption(event.target.value)
          }}
        >
          <option value="red">
            Red
          </option>
          <option value="green">
            Green
          </option>
          <option value="blue">
            Blue
          </option>
        </select>
      </fieldset>
      
      <p>
        Selected value:
        <br />
        {selectedOption}
      </p>
    </form>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- By setting the `value` prop, we make this a controlled component, binding the selected option to our React state.
- When we add the `onChange` event listener, we allow this state to be changed by selecting a different option form the list.

- This feels like a huge improvement, compared to default functionality of this form control. We don't ahe to mess with adding the `selected` attribute to one of the `<option>` children.

#### Radio Buttons

- Radio buttons, allow the user to select one choice from a group of options.
- The tricky thing, is state is split across multiple independent HTML elements.
- There is only one `<select>` tag, but multiple `<input type="radio">` buttons.
- An example of a controlled radio button group in React:

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  const [
    value,
    setValue
  ] = React.useState('no');

  return (
    <form>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Do you agree?</legend>
        
        <input
          type="radio"
          name="agreed-to-terms"
          id="agreed-yes"
          value="yes"
          checked={value === "yes"}
          onChange={event => {
            setValue(event.target.value)
          }}
        />
        {' '}
        <label htmlFor="agreed-yes">
          Yes
        </label>
        <br />
        
        <input
          type="radio"
          name="agreed-to-terms"
          id="agreed-no"
          value="no"
          checked={value === "no"}
          onChange={event => {
            setValue(event.target.value)
          }}
        />
        {' '}
        <label htmlFor="agreed-no">
          No
        </label>
      </fieldset>
    </form>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- Radio has a ton of properties.
- `name` - The browser needs to know that each button is part of the same group, so selecting one option will de-select the others. This is done with the `name` prop. Each radio button ina group should share the same `name`.
- `value` - Each radio button has its own value. This property will be copied over to our React state when the option is ticked. This is the definition / meaning for each radio button.
- `id` - like other form controls, this is needed so that the `<label>` can be associated with he right input, so that clicking the label focuses the input.
- `checked` - This is the prop that binds a given radio button to our React state, making it a controlled value. It should be set to a boolean value: `true` if it's ticked, `false` if it is not. Only one radio button should be set to `true` at a time.

- In most cases we bind React state to `value`. In this case, we don't have a single `value` prop to bind to, since we have multiple radio buttons.
- So instead, we bind to `checked`, controlling the ticked/unticked status for each button in the group with React state.

### Exercises, Forms

- Form exercises

#### Controlled Country Picker

- AC's
- Use the `COUNTRIES` constant to dynamically generate a th set of `<option>` elements.
  - In order to map over an object,t you will need to use  something like Object.keys() or Object.entries()
- There should be a 'blank' option, selected by default. It shouldn't default to the first country in the list.
- The indicator at the bottom should update when the user changes their selected country.
- No warnings in the dev console.

```JAVASCRIPT
// starter code
import React from 'react';

import { COUNTRIES } from './data';

/*
  ‚ÄúCOUNTRIES‚Äù is a dictionary-like object
  with the following shape:

  {
    AF: "Afghanistan",
    AL: "Albania",
    DZ: "Algeria",
  }
*/

function App() {
  const [
    country,
    setCountry,
  ] = React.useState('');

  return (
    <form>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Shipping Info</legend>
        <label htmlFor="country">
          Country:
        </label>
        <select
          id="country"
          name="country"
        >
          {/* TODO: Options here! */}
        </select>
      </fieldset>

      <p className="country-display">
        Selected country: {country}
      </p>

      <button>Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- Use `Object.entries(COUNTRIES)` to get the data.
- `countryNames` is an array of arrays. Every array inside has exactly two items. First one is the ID, key of the object, and the second item is the value.
- The ID, keys are the unique identifier for each country. This is what we are going to use in our React state.
- Then you can use that with `map()` to iterate over all the countries.
- And use destructuring, to get variables the array.
- Remember, `countryName` is an array of an array, and every array has exactly two items. `['US', 'United States']`
- First item is going to be the country code, `'CA'`
- Second item is the country label, like `'Canada'`

```JAVASCRIPT
// ['CA', 'Canada'], you can destructure that data and use it in your function.
countryNames.map(([id, label]) => {
  return (
    <option>
      {label}
    </option>
  )
})
```

- Now the countries will be rendered out in the select.
- Also on the `<option>`, add the `value={id}` and use that as the key, `key={id}`.
- Now I want to use the `id` as the value, since that will be set in react state. `value={id}`
- And since the `id` is unique, you can use that as the `key`, `key={id}`.

- Event, add the `onChange` handler to the select.

```JAVASCRIPT
onChange={event => {
  console.log(event.target);
}}
```

- And to get the value, just update to `event.target.value`
- Then take that value and put it into your state setter, `setCountry()` function.

```JAVASCRIPT
onChange={event => {
  setCountry(event.target.value);
}}
```

- Now you see the selected country update in the UI, because we are passing it along to `react.state`

- Now we have to do the data binding.
- So you have two way data binding, and if you want to pre-populate the state. `value={country}`

```JAVASCRIPT
  <select
    id="country"
    name="country"
    value={country}
    onChange={event => {
      setCountry(event.target.value);
    }}
  >
```

- Setting an initial value, empty string, `React.useState('')`
- In the `select` add an option for the empty / default

```JAVASCRIPT
   <select
     required
     id="country"
     name="country"
     value={country}
     onChange={event => {
       setCountry(event.target.value);
     }}
   >
     {/* TODO: Options here! */}
     <option value="">-- Select Country --</option>
     {countryNames.map(([id, label]) => {
        return (
          <option value={id} key={id}>
            {label}
          </option>
        )
     }
     )}
   </select>
```

- One nice thing, when you set the `value=""` to empty, and add the `required` property to the `select`, you get some built in validation.

- Nice UX enhancement, to add a `<optgroup label="Countries"></optgroup>` around the options, makes a nice nested feel to the countries list.
- The last thing, is to display the full name of the country.

```JAVASCRIPT
  <p className="country-display">
    Selected country: {COUNTRIES[country]}
  </p>
```

- Full solution:

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';

import { COUNTRIES } from './data';

/*
  ‚ÄúCOUNTRIES‚Äù is a dictionary-like object
  with the following shape:

  {
    AF: "Afghanistan",
    AL: "Albania",
    DZ: "Algeria",
  }
*/

const countryNames = Object.entries(COUNTRIES);
// console.log(countryNames);

function App() {
  const [
    country,
    setCountry,
  ] = React.useState('');

  return (
    <form>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Shipping Info</legend>
        <label htmlFor="country">
          Country:
        </label>
        <select
          required
          id="country"
          name="country"
          value={country}
          onChange={event => {
            setCountry(event.target.value);
          }}
        >
          <option value="">-- Select Country --</option>
          <optgroup label="Countries">
            {countryNames.map(([id, label]) => {
               return (
                 <option value={id} key={id}>
                   {label}
                 </option>
               )
            }
            )}
          </optgroup>

        </select>
      </fieldset>

      <p className="country-display">
        Selected country: {COUNTRIES[country]}
      </p>

      <button>Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Exercise, Two Factor Authentication

- Two factor authentication is teh best practice in terms of secure sign in. The most common pattern is to prompt the user to enter a short code from the app.

- Let's build this form.
- AC's
  - The input value should be held in React state.
  - When the user submits their code, a `window.alert` should let them know whether it's correct or not, by comparing their submitted value with teh `CORRECT_CODE` constant.
  - A `<form>` tag should dbe used.

- Hint: You need to mange default behavior.

```JAVASCRIPT
// starter code
import React from 'react';

const CORRECT_CODE = '123456';

function TwoFactor() {
  return (
    <>
      <label htmlFor="auth-code">
        Enter authorization code:
      </label>
      <div className="row">
        <input
          id="auth-code"
          type="text"
          required={true}
          maxLength={6}
        />
        <button>Validate</button>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}

export default TwoFactor;
```

- **My attempt:**
- AC's
- The input value should be held in React state.

```JAVASCRIPT
  const [code, setCode] = React.useState('');
```

- When the user submits their code,a `window.alert` should let them know whether it's correct or not, by comparing their submitted value with the `CORRRECT_CODE` constant.

```JAVASCRIPT
    if (code === CORRECT_CODE) {
      window.alert('correct');
    } else 
      window.alert('please try again');

    // you could also do this with ternary
    code ===  CORRECT_CODE ? window.alert('correct') : window.alert('please try again');
```

- A `<form>` tag should be used and manage the default behavior

```JAVASCRIPT
    <form
      onSubmit={event => {
        event.preventDefault();
        code ===  CORRECT_CODE ? window.alert('correct') : window.alert('please try again');
      }}
    >
```

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';

const CORRECT_CODE = '123456';

function TwoFactor() {

  const [code, setCode] = React.useState('');
  
  return (
    <form
      onSubmit={event => {
        event.preventDefault();
          if (code === CORRECT_CODE) {
            window.alert('correct')
          } else 
            window.alert('please try again');
      }}
    >
      <label htmlFor="auth-code">
        Enter authorization code:
      </label>
      <div className="row">
        <input
          id="auth-code"
          type="text"
          required={true}
          maxLength={6}
          value={code}
          onChange={(event) => {
            setCode(event.target.value);
            console.log(code);
          }}
        />
        <button>Validate</button>
      </div>
    </form>
  );
}

export default TwoFactor;
```

- Josh's solution:
- Creates a separate function for the submit.

```JAVASCRIPT
  function handleSubmit(event) {
    // prevent the default behavior browser refresh
    event.preventDefault();
    // Creates a boolean value
    const isCorrect = code === CORRECT_CODE;
    window.alert(isCorrect ? 'Correct!' : 'Incorrect');
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
    // rest of stuff here
    </form>
  )
```

### Exercise, Generative Art

- Build some generative art in this exercise.
- Wire up the form controls to the Rect state so when update the forms, they will tweak the art.

- AC's

1. The range slider should be bound to the `numOfLines` state.
2. The select control should be bound to the `colorTheme` state.
3. The radio buttons should be bound to the `shape` state.
4. The radio button labels should work correctly. The user should be able to click the text "Polygons" to select that option.
5. The inputs should conform to the HTML standards, eg. radio buttons should be grouped using the "name attribute.

- Note: All change should happen in the `App.js.`

- My attempt:

1. The range slider should be bound to the `numOfLines` state.

```JAVASCRIPT
// React state: const [numOfLines, setNumOfLines] = React.useState(5);
    <label
      htmlFor="num-of-lines"
      className="control-heading"
    >
      Number of Lines:
    </label>
    <input
      id="num-of-lines"
      type="range"
      min="1"
      max="15"
      value={numOfLines}
      onChange={(element) => {
        return (
          setNumOfLines(element.target.value)
        )
      }}
    />
```

2. The select control should be bound to the `colorTheme` state.

```JAVASCRIPT
// React state: const [colorTheme, setColorTheme] = React.useState('basic');
    <label
      className="control-heading"
      htmlFor="color-theme"
    >
      Color Theme:
    </label>
    <select 
      id="color-theme"
      value={colorTheme}
      onChange={(element) => {
        return (
          setColorTheme(element.target.value)
        )
      }}
    >
      <option value="basic">
        Basic
      </option>
      <option value="monochrome">
        Monochrome
      </option>
      <option value="fruit-loops">
        Fruit Loops
      </option>
      <option value="spooky">
        Spooky Night
      </option>
    </select>
```

3. The radio buttons should be bound to the `shape` state.

- For radio buttons, use the `checked` property to manage the state. We are saying that this input should be checked if a certain condition is true. Add a condition on the `checked` property. `checked={shape === "circles}` then this input/radio should be checked.

```JAVASCRIPT
    <div className="radio-wrapper">
      <div className="radio-option">
        <input 
          type="radio" 
          name="choose-shape"
          id="shape-circles"
          value="circles"
          checked={shape === "circles"}
          onChange={(element) => {
            return (
              setShape(element.target.value)
            )
          }}
        />
        <label htmlFor="shape-circles">
          Circles
        </label>
      </div>
      <div className="radio-option">
        <input 
          type="radio"
          name="choose-shape"
          id="shape-polygons"
          value="polygons"
          checked={shape === "polygons"}
          onChange={(element) => {
            return (
              setShape(element.target.value)
            )
          }}
        />
        <label htmlFor="shape-polygons">
          Polygons
        </label>
      </div>
    </div>
```

1. The radio button labels should work correctly. The user should be able to click the text "Polygons" to select that option.

- Radio buttons, to make them part of the same group, add the `name="my-radio` property to all the radio button in the same group.
- To make the label interactive so you can click on it. Give the radio button input an `id="shape-circle"` and then give the corresponding label the same value, but use the `htmlFor="shape-circle"` attribute.

```JAVASCRIPT
    <div className="radio-option">
      <input 
        type="radio"
        name="choose-shape"
        id="shape-polygons"
        value="polygons"
        checked={shape === "polygons"}
        onChange={(element) => {
          return (
            setShape(element.target.value)
          )
        }}
      />
      <label htmlFor="shape-polygons">
        Polygons
      </label>
    </div>
```

  Note: Do things in a conventional DOM friendly way, and you will sidestep a whole lot of issues from server side rendering. If React does not load for example, the browser can still perform the functionality.

## Prop Vs. State

- When learning React it is normal for the concepts of "props" and "state" to be a bit confusing and intermingled.
- What is the difference between them exactly? When do you use props and when to use state?

### Props

- "Props is short for "properties". At the micro level, the are like the attributes we place on HTML elements, like `class` or `href`:

```JAVASCRIPT
  <a
    class="nav-link"
    href="/category/stuff"
  >
```

- For example, the `Button` component below takes a "variant" prop. This prop will be used internally to control styling, like how the `class` attribute works in HTML.

```JAVASCRIPT
    import Button from './Button';

    function App() {
      return (
        <div className="box">
          <p>
            Are you sure you want to continue?
          </p>
          <div className="actions">
            <Button variant="secondary">
              Cancel
            </Button>
            <Button variant="primary">
              Confirm
            </Button>
          </div>
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default App;
```

- Props allow us to customize behavior of a given component, so the exact same component can do different things in different scenarios.

- üöÄ **Props are the inputs to our components, like arguments passed to a function.**
  
### State

- In the example above, our application is static. every time we run this code, we get the same results.
- But what if we wanted stuff to change over time? **That's where state comes in.**

- Let's tweak our example:

```JAVASCRIPT
    import React from 'react';

    import Button from './Button';

    function App() {
      const [hasAgreed, setHasAgreed] = React.useState(false);
      
      return (
        <div className="box">
          <p>
            Are you sure you want to continue?
          </p>
          <label htmlFor="confirm-checkbox">
            <span className="required">*</span>
            <input
              id="confirm-checkbox"
              type="checkbox"
              value={hasAgreed}
              onChange={() => setHasAgreed(!hasAgreed)}
            />
            <span>
              I agree with <a href="/terms">the terms</a>.
            </span>
          </label>
          <div className="actions">
            <Button
              variant="secondary"
              isEnabled={true}
            >
              Cancel
            </Button>
            <Button
              variant="primary"
              isEnabled={hasAgreed}
            >
              Confirm
            </Button>
          </div>
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default App;
```

- We have a new bit of state, `hasAgreed`, and we need to use that data to power our "confirm" button.
- This reveals an important truth about props: **they are tunnels that allow data to flow through our application.**

- Let's dig in, video
- When you create a state variable, it is only available within the component. It's not global or available to other components.
- Two ways to think about it:
  - Props are used to control the configuration of a particular instance of a component.
  - Props are also, the tracks we use to funnel data from one place to another. **The way, parent components communicate to children components.** They are the tunnels that connect our different components.

- ü§î The data that we can use in our props, can be a string, boolean, or we can use react state.
- We use a prop, to pass a bit of state to one place to another.

- Props are basically a subway network, a system of tunnels we can use to funnel data around.

## Complex State

- So far we have seen how store numbers and strings in React state. Most times, our state will be in a more complex shape, ike an object or an array.

- For example; in the previous exercise, the gradient generator tool where users select 2 to 5 colors, and use state to generate a gradient.
- How to you keep track of the state for the colors?

- In this case, the `colors` state variable, hold an array of strings:

```JAVASCRIPT
  const [colors, setColors] = React.useState(['#FFD500', '#FF0040']);
```

- React doesn't care what type out state is. We can store numbers or strings or arrays or objects. We can even store functions in state if we want!

- üëÄ But there's a catch, React state changes have to be immutable.
- When we call `setColors`, we need to provide a brand new array.
- **We should never mutate arrays or objects help in state**

- Immutability is a big topic in JS. You can see the lesson in the JS primer, [Assignment vs. Mutation](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/joy-of-react/10-javascript-primer/11-assignment-vs-mutation)

### Mutation Bugs

- Video summary:
- In our color picker example, we are unable to choose the colors.
- The problem, when we use complex state, with arrays or objects, we have to specify a new array.
- Otherwise, React doesn't think we changed anything.
**- React uses, reference equality as a way to check if something has changed.**
- React will check, is the object or array you are passing me, the same entity, the same reference, if it is, React does not re-render. React figures it is intentional.

- Refresher: equality, objects, memory, pointers, really important to have a firm grasp on these concepts.
- For this exercise, startup a node console to explore these concepts. New terminal, `node`

- Create a new array

```JAVASCRIPT
  let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

- Then create a new variable called `nextArr` and assign it to `arr`

```JAVASCRIPT
  let nextArr = arr;
```

- Then, take `nextArr` and modify the first value to be equal to 5

```JAVASCRIPT
  nextArr[0] = 5
```

- Now, the question is, what is the value of `arr`? You might think, the value is the same, because you didn't change `arr`, you changed `nextArr`
- But when you check the value of `arr`, is has the new initial value of 5. `[5, 2, 3, 4]`
- In fact, `nextArr === arr` is `true`, exactly equal to each other.
- What is going on here in JS? We don't have to think about the high level memory storage. In JS, whenever we write a variable, it makes a physical change in the computer, stores it in RAM.
- And the variable is just a pointer to that.

- For example; our `arr` variable, just points to this array held in memory.
- And when you say, `let nextArr = arr;`, we are not creating a new array, you are just pointing `arr` and `nextArr` to the same thing, same array.
- Both variables point to the same entity that exist in memory.
- When we change an item in `nextArr`, we are changing the same item, we are not creating a clone of it.

- If you take two arrays, with the exact same value, are they equal?

```JAVASCRIPT
  [1, 2, 3] === [1, 2, 3]
  // false
```

- This is `false` because you have two separate arrays.
**- The way JS works, you have objects in memory, and variables that point to them**

- What if you wanted to create a copy with the same values?
- You can use the spread operator `...`, this will copy the contents of the array.

```JAVASCRIPT
  let betterCloneArr = [...arr]
  // [ 5, 2, 3, 4 ]
```

- This works not matter how many values you have, it is unpacking the array into the new `betterCloneArr` variable.
- And it's creating a new array
- Now notice, `betterCloneArr` is not equal to `arr`

```JAVASCRIPT
  betterCloneArr === arr
  // false
```

- And a good blog post, [visual reference to JS](https://daveceddia.com/javascript-references/)

- In our color picker example, all that matters is that React gets a new object and does the re-render.

### Never mutate React state (even when it seems to work)

- In the example, we follow these steps

1. Create a new array
2. Modify that new array
3. Set the new array into state

- Is it OK to flip the order of the first two steps? What is we modify the array, then clone it? Like this:

```JAVASCRIPT
  <input
  onChange={event => {
    // Mutate the array:
    colors[index] = event.target.value;

    // Create a new copy, and set it into state:
    setColors([...colors]);
  }}
/>
```

- Seems simpler, right? Make whatever modifications we want, and then copy the array right before we call `setColors`, so that we are providing a new value.

- **Here is the problem**. By doing it this way, we are modifying the values held in React state.
- React really doesn't expect us to do this, and has no guardrails in place to warn us if we try.

- You might get lucky and get away with it once, but if you make a habit of it, you will likely start getting weird / glitchy behavior.
- A random part fo the page won't be updated when supposed to. Or maybe the DOM structure will get shuffled, putting elements in different parts of the DOM.

- These bugs are really hard to diagnose and fix, you will save yourself a whole lot of trouble if you do your best to avoid mutating React state.

### But isn't' this inefficient?  

- To create brand new arrays on every single change, isn't that inefficient? Wouldn't it be more performant to mutate the existing array instead?
- When it comes to React state, these is no choice; we need to produce a new array whenever the state changes.

- Fortunately, this isn't an issue. Cloning an array is an incredibly quick operation.

- In our color gradient picker example, when we clone the `[...colors]` array, it takes about 2 microseconds.
- That's two millionths of a second. For context, the average human blink is 100 milliseconds; we could clone 50,000 arrays in the blink of an eye.

### Exercises, Complex State

- Working on the gradient generator tool! Instead of limiting the user to 2 colors, let's ad up to 5 colors.

- AC's
  - The color inputs should work; picking a new color should update the gradient accordingly.
  - Clicking "Add color" should add a new color, at the end of the array.
  - Clicking "Remove color" should remove the last color in the array.
  - When adding new colors, they should default to `FF0000` bright red.
  - There should always be between 2 and 5 colors. No more, no less. The user should be given feedback as to why the buttons stop working once they hit a limit.

- Starter code, gradient picker

```JAVASCRIPT
// App.js
import React from 'react';
function App() {
  const [colors, setColors] = React.useState([
    '#FFD500',
    '#FF0040',
  ]);
  
  const colorStops = colors.join(', ');
  const backgroundImage = `linear-gradient(${colorStops})`;

  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <div className="actions">
        <button>
          Remove color
        </button>
        <button>
          Add color
        </button>
      </div>
      
      <div
        className="gradient-preview"
        style={{
          backgroundImage,
        }}
      />
      
      <div className="colors">
        {colors.map((color, index) => {
          const colorId = `color-${index}`;
          return (
            <div key={colorId} className="color-wrapper">
              <label htmlFor={colorId}>
                Color {index + 1}:
              </label>
              <div className="input-wrapper">
                <input
                  id={colorId}
                  type="color"
                  value={color}
                  onChange={(element) => {
                      // create a new array
                      const nextColors = [...colors];
                      // mutate it
                      nextColors[index] = event.target.value;
                      // add to state
                      setColors(nextColors);
                      console.log(colors);
                  }}
                />
              </div>
            </div>
          );
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- AC: The color inputs should work; picking a new color should update the gradient accordingly.

```JAVASCRIPT
<div className="input-wrapper">
    <input
      id={colorId}
      type="color"
      // add a value to make a controlled
      value={color}
      onChange={(element) => {
          // create a new array
          const nextColors = [...colors];
          // mutate it
          nextColors[index] = event.target.value;
          // add to state
          setColors(nextColors);
          console.log(colors);
  />
</div>
```

- AC: Clicking "Add color" should add a new color, at the end of the array.
- Tip ü§î Don't forget the rule about 'Never Mutate React State',
  - 1. Create a new array
  - 2. Modify that new array
  - 3. Set that new array into state

```JAVASCRIPT
   <button
     onClick={(event) => {
       console.log(event.target)
       // create a new array
       let newColors = [...colors]
       // modify that array, set default to red
       newColors.push("#FF0000")
       // set it to state
       setColors(newColors)
       console.log(colors)
     }}
   >
     Add color
   </button>
```

- AC: Clicking "Remove color" should remove the last color in the array. Don't forget about about the react mutate rule.

```JAVASCRIPT
  <button
    onClick={(event) => {
      console.log(event.target)
      // 1. create a new array
      let removeColor = [...colors]
      // 2. modify that array
      removeColor.pop()
      // 3. set to state
      setColors(removeColor)
      console.log(`new colors ${colors}`)
    }}
  >
    Remove color
  </button>
```

- AC: When adding new colors, they should default to `#FF000` (bright red).

```JAVASCRIPT
       // modify that array, set default to red
       newColors.push("#FF0000")
```

- AC: There should always be between 2 and 5 colors. No more, no less. The user should be given feedback as to why the buttons stop working once they hit a limit.

```JAVASCRIPT
// my attempt
// get the number or colors from the colors array
// if 2 colors, disable the remove button, throw an alert
// if 5 colors, disable the add button, throw an alert
```

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';
function App() {
  const [colors, setColors] = React.useState([
    '#FFD500',
    '#FF0040',
  ]);
  
  const colorStops = colors.join(', ');
  const backgroundImage = `linear-gradient(${colorStops})`;

  // function for the minimum
  function colorMin(param) {
    console.log(param)
    param < 2 ? alert('min of 2') : undefined
  }

  // function for the max
  function colorMax(param) {
    console.log(param)
    param > 5 ? alert('max of 5') : undefined
  }

                      const nextColors = [...colors];
                      // mutate it
                      nextColors[index] = event.target.value;
                      // add to state
                      setColors(nextColors);
                      console.log(colors);
                  }}
                />
              </div>
            </div>
          );
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- Video Solution:
- For the condition AC, to check the minimum and max conditions
- Create a separate function for the `addColor` and `removeColor` with and if statement for the min, max requirement.

```JAVASCRIPT
  function addColor() {
    if (colors.length >=5) {
      window.alert('There is a maximum of 5 colors')
      return; //stops here
    }
     // 1. create a new array
     let newColors = [...colors]
     // 2. modify that array
     newColors.push("#FF0000")
     // 3. set it to state
     setColors(newColors)    
  }

  function removeColor() {
    if(colors.length <=2) {
      window.alert('There is a minimum of 2 colors')
      return; //stops here
    }
      // 1. create a new array
      let removeColor = [...colors]
      // 2. modify that array
      removeColor.pop()
      // 3. set to state
      setColors(removeColor)
  }
```

## Dynamic Key Generation

- When interating over data with `.map`, we nee dto give each Rect element a unique `key` attribute so that React knows which DOM operations to trigger between renders.

- In previous exercises, the data conveniently came with unique tokens for each item, and we used those tokens:

```JAVASCRIPT
const inventory = [
  {
    id: 'abc123',
    name: 'Soft-boiled egg press',
  },
  {
    id: 'def456',
    name: 'Hello Kitty toothbrush',
  },
];

// We can use the `id` field in our iterations:
inventory.map(item => (
  <ShopItem key={item.id} item={item} />
));
```

- But what if our data doesn't have a unique token we can use?

- This is one of the most common questions that developers have. React needs a unique value for each item, but we don't have one.
- Sometimes we can use the array index for the key, but this approach doesn't always work. How can we solve this problem?

### Stickers example

- This example, when you click to produce random stickers:
- The core logic is done, but we get an warning in the console. Let's fix it.

- The goal is to fix the key warning by dynamically generating the keys for each sticker. We don't want to use the array index this time around.

```JAVASCRIPT
// starter code
import React from 'react';

import styles from './StickerPad.module.css';
import { getSticker } from './Stickers.data';

function StickerPad() {
  const [stickers, setStickers] = React.useState([]);

  return (
    <button
      className={styles.wrapper}
      onClick={(event) => {
        const stickerData = getSticker();
        const newSticker = {
          ...stickerData,
          x: event.clientX,
          y: event.clientY,
        };

        const nextStickers = [...stickers, newSticker];
        setStickers(nextStickers);
      }}
    >
      {stickers.map((sticker) => (
        <img
          className={styles.sticker}
          src={sticker.src}
          alt={sticker.alt}
          style={{
            left: sticker.x,
            top: sticker.y,
            width: sticker.width,
            height: sticker.height,
          }}
        />
      ))}
    </button>
  );
}

export default StickerPad;
```

- In order for React to work in the optimal way, it needs a unique identifier for each of the images

```JAVASCRIPT
   <img
     // need to set a key
     key={}
     className={styles.sticker}
     src={sticker.src}
     alt={sticker.alt}
     style={{
       left: sticker.x,
       top: sticker.y,
       width: sticker.width,
       height: sticker.height,
     }}
   />
```

- We don't have a unique identifier in the data file. You can try to use the src.

```JAVASCRIPT
const STICKERS = [
  {
    src: 'https://sandpack-bundler.vercel.app/img/stickers/cactus.svg',
    alt: 'potted cactus sticker',
    width: 295 / 2,
    height: 452 / 2,
  }
]
```

- You can try to use the source `key={sticker.src}`, but the moment you have two of the same, you get an key error in the console.
- Or you could try and dynamically generate a string based on multiple properties, this is better but you can still get key errors.

```JAVASCRIPT
  key={`${sticker.src}-${sticker.x}-${sticker.y}`}
```

- What if you try and use a random value, `key={Math.random}`, seems to work, you don't get any warnings. But still not a good idea. The reason is performance. Think about the role of the key, to tell React how things should change and update.

```JAVASCRIPT
   <img
     // need to set a key
     key={Math.random()}
     className={styles.sticker}
     src={sticker.src}
     alt={sticker.alt}
     style={{
       left: sticker.x,
       top: sticker.y,
       width: sticker.width,
       height: sticker.height,
     }}
   />
```

- Every time you give a new key, you are telling React to re-render that element in the DOM. Even though you didn't need to, or nothing changed, all the same properties.
- When you use `Math.random` as the `key` it is destroying all the DOM elements and creating new ones each time. Over time this can cause inefficiencies and performance issues.

- This concept is a good idea, to generate a unique value each time
- The problem is, we don't want to do it in the render, on the element, every time we update the stickers array.

- What if we did it on the handler, `onClick` handler.
- On the `newSticker` object, we set `id: Math.random()`
- Then on the `img` element, we set the key to `key={sticker.id}`

- If you console.log the `stickers` object, you will see the id, and how it does not change when you add new stickers, the id persists.
- It generates the id, only on the `onClick`, when you first generate the sticker. Every other time, is just uses the static value of `key={sticker.id}`
- We have create a persistent id, a real static value, and React will know, if it has to do any work to re-render or not.

```JAVASCRIPT
  return (
    <button
      className={styles.wrapper}
      onClick={(event) => {
        const stickerData = getSticker();
        const newSticker = {
          ...stickerData,
          x: event.clientX,
          y: event.clientY,
          // Add to the handler, generate a unique id
          id: Math.random(),
        };

        const nextStickers = [...stickers, newSticker];
        setStickers(nextStickers);
      }}
     >
      {stickers.map((sticker) => (
        <img
          // Use that previously created unique value for teh key:
          // Apply it to the element:
          key={sticker.id}
          className={styles.sticker}
          src={sticker.src}
          alt={sticker.alt}
          style={{
            left: sticker.x,
            top: sticker.y,
            width: sticker.width,
            height: sticker.height,
          }}
        />
      ))}
    </button>
  );
```

- You can use other methods, to generate a unique id, `Date.now()`, or `crypto.randomUUID()` ü§î this is not cryptography not cryptocurrency üòÑ, this generates a UUID, really long.

- This is the strategy, create a unique identifier when you create the object, you can use this when fetching data, the moment you get that data back, you can add unique identifiers to the object

## Lifting State Up

- In React, lifting state up is one of the core React concepts, and really important. One of the most critical lessons in this course.

- Video notes:
- Data fetching, API request to the backend, to fetch all the information.
- In this example, a simple search UI, with an `<App/>` and two children components, `<SearchForm />`, and `<SearchResults />`

- `<SearchForm />` is the component that holds the actual state, `searchTerm`
- The state is defined in `<SearchForm />`

```JAVASCRIPT
function SearchForm() {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState('');
}
```

- ü§î Initially, you might think you can just push the state from one component to the other, two way, regardless of parent child relationship. Any part of the application could access any other part of the application, it's data or state.
- The problem is, over time you end up with spaghetti code. You end up with this situation where everything is pointing to everything.
- You get in a situation, where, can I change or remove this bit of state, what far area of the app will this impact or break?
- Very poor visibility in how these things are setup?

- üì£ üì£ The rule in React, is that data can only pass through components via props, or via context. üì£ üì£
- We have to follow the lines of our application.
- Have some data in `<App />` we would be able to pass some data down to it children, `<SearchForm />` and `<SearchResults />` through props.

```JAVASCRIPT
  // App.js
  function App() {
    return (
      <>
        <header>
          <a className="logo" href="/">
            Wanda‚Äôs Fruits
          </a>
          <SearchForm />
        </header>
        <main>
          <SearchResults />
        </main>
      </>
    );
  }
```

- The way we solve this problem, WE HAVE TO LIFT THE STATE UP, we have to lift it up higher in the tree.
- ü§î As long as a parent can pass to a child, THAT'S HOW THE WHOLE DATA FLOW WORKS.
- This is also called, unidirectional data flow:
  - parents can pass to children
  - but children cannot pass to parents
  - and siblings cannot pass to siblings
- DATA ALWAYS FLOWS IN THIS SINGULAR DIRECTION

- In our search example, we are going to lift the state up, to the `<App/>` component.

```JAVASCRIPT
// App.js
import React from 'react';

import SearchForm from './SearchForm';
import SearchResults from './SearchResults';

function App() {
  // Lift the state up to App
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState('');
  // Pass it down below via props in each component
  return (
    <>
      <header>
        <a className="logo" href="/">
          Wanda‚Äôs Fruits
        </a>
        <SearchForm  searchTerm={searchTerm}/>
      </header>
      <main>
        <SearchResults searchTerm={searchTerm}/>
      </main>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- Then add a new prop, to the child components, `<SearchForm />` and `<SearchResults />`

```JAVASCRIPT
// SearchForm.js
import React from 'react';

// pass in the prop searchTerm
function SearchForm({ searchTerm }) {
  
  function runSearch(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    
    // Actual search stuff omitted from
    // this example.
  }
  
  return (
    <form onSubmit={runSearch}>
      <label
        className="visually-hidden"
        htmlFor="search-input"
      >
        Search term:
      </label>
      <input
        id="search-input"
        className="search-input"
        // bind to the form
        value={searchTerm}
        onChange={event => {
          setSearchTerm(event.target.value);
        }}
      />
      <button>
        Search
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default SearchForm;
```

```JAVASCRIPT
// SearchResults.js
function SearchResults({ searchTerm }) {
  return (
    <p>
      You searched for: {searchTerm}.
    </p>
  );
}

export default SearchResults;
```

- Now if you set the default value in the `useState()` in the parent component `<App />` you will see it passed down to the children components.
- We passed down a static value, but how do you update this state? When someone searches in the form, how do you update the state now.

- ü§î How do you write to state that lives in a different component? ü§î
- Functions in JS, is data just like any other data, JS is a functional programming language.
- üöÄ You can just pass down the state function, `setSearchTerm` down as a prop, so the children have access to it, you can pass down a function as a prop, just like any other data. And that child component will have access to it.

```JAVASCRIPT
// App.js, pass down the setSearchTerm state function
    <SearchForm  
      searchTerm={searchTerm}
      setSearchTerm={setSearchTerm}
    />
```

- Then in your child component, pass in the `setSearchTerm` function, so the form can be updated.

```JAVASCRIPT
// SearchForm.js
function SearchForm({ searchTerm, setSearchTerm }) {
  // component here
}
```

- Step by Step Review, walk though what happens when you make a single change to our search input.

- Type the letter `a`. The first thing that happens is the `onChange` event fires on the `<SearchForm />` component.
- The `onChange` event, evokes the `setSearchTerm` function, passing in the new value, which is the letter `a`, grabbing it from `event.target.value`.

```JAVASCRIPT
  onChange={event => {
    setSearchTerm(event.target.value);
  }}
```

- Whenever you call a state setter function in react, it is going to re-render that component that owns that bit of state.
- Because the `setSearchTerm` function is owned by `<App/>` the app component re-renders. Whenever their is a change in the state, `searchTerm`, the component re-renders.
- So when `searchTerm` is updates in state, it tells react to update the component, and any children components.
- So `<App/>` updates and forces a re-render for `<SearchForm/>` and `<SearchResults/>`

```JAVASCRIPT
function App() {
  
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState('');
  
  return (
    <>
      <header>
        <a className="logo" href="/">
          Wanda‚Äôs Fruits
        </a>
        <SearchForm  
          searchTerm={searchTerm}
          setSearchTerm={setSearchTerm}
        />
      </header>
      <main>
        <SearchResults searchTerm={searchTerm}/>
      </main>
    </>
  );
}
```

- So when `<SearchResults />` re-renders, it is now equal to the search term, `a`

- Now, in a larger application, where do you lift the state to?
- You might think, I can just lift up the state, all the way up to `<App />`, that way every single component would have access if needed.
- But not a best practice, a couple reasons
  - **Performance**, we only want to re-render the components that require the data. If you put the state to far up, you will be re-rendering components that don't care about that data.
  - **Code organization**, hard to manage that many state hooks in the same component, unique names for it all. A simple blog for example, could have hundreds of state hooks.
- ü§î You should find the lowest ancestor, you want to move the state as low as you can but no lower.
- üöÄ This is our strategy, for lifting state up. üöÄ

### Exercises, Lifting up State

- Exercises for lifing up state

#### Cookie Clicker

- We will build a simple version of the cookie clicker game, but instead we will use a Canadian toonie, whatever that is.

- AC's
  - "Your coin balance", at the bottom of the page, should update to show the value of `numOfCoins`.
  - Clicking the coin should increment this value by 2, since it's a $2 coin.

- Parent Component

```JAVASCRIPT
// App.js
import React from 'react';

import BigCoin from './BigCoin';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <main>
        <BigCoin />
      </main>
      <footer>
        Your coin balance:
        <strong>0</strong>
      </footer>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- The child component

```JAVASCRIPT
// BigCoin.js
import React from 'react';
import './BigCoin.css';

function BigCoin() {
  const [numOfCoins, setNumOfCoins] = React.useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div className="coin-wrapper">
      <button
        className="coin"
        onClick={() => setNumOfCoins(numOfCoins + 2)}
      >
        <span className="visually-hidden">
          Add 2 coins
        </span>
        <img
          className="coin-image"
          alt=""
          src="https://sandpack-bundler.vercel.app/img/toonie.png"
        />
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default BigCoin;
```

- AC 1: "Your coin balance", at the bottom of the page, should update to show the value of `numOfCoins`.
  - Lift up the state, and pass it down to `<BigCoin/>` component
- AC 2: Pass in the state variable in the footer.

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';

import BigCoin from './BigCoin';

function App() {

  // lift up state
  const [numOfCoins, setNumOfCoins] = React.useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <main>
        <BigCoin 
          numOfCoins={numOfCoins}
          setNumOfCoins={setNumOfCoins}
        />
      </main>
      <footer>
        Your coin balance:
        <strong>{numOfCoins}</strong>
      </footer>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- Pass down the state via props to the `<BigCoin />` component

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';
import './BigCoin.css';

function BigCoin({ numOfCoins, setNumOfCoins }) {
  
  return (
    <div className="coin-wrapper">
      <button
        className="coin"
        onClick={() => {
          setNumOfCoins(numOfCoins + 2)
          console.log(numOfCoins)
        }}
      >
        <span className="visually-hidden">
          Add 2 coins
        </span>
        <img
          className="coin-image"
          alt=""
          src="https://sandpack-bundler.vercel.app/img/toonie.png"
        />
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default BigCoin;
```

#### Exercise, Shopping List

- Let's build our own shopping list, the design and JSX is already implemented, but it is entirely static.
- Your job is to update the code so that it works.

- AC's
- 1. The shown list of items should be driven from React state. We can remove the placeholder foods, and start wtih an empty list.
- 2. Submitting the form should add a new item to the list, and show it in the UI.
- 3. When submitting the form, the text input should be reset, so that it's empty. This way, users can easily add multiple items without having to erase their previous entry.
- 4. There should be no "key" warnings in the console. Ideally, you shouldn't use the index for the key.

- Starter code

```JAVASCRIPT
// App.js
import React from 'react';

import AddNewItemForm from './AddNewItemForm';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <div className="list-wrapper">
        <ol className="shopping-list">
          <li>Avocados</li>
          <li>Broccoli</li>
          <li>Carrots</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <AddNewItemForm />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- Child component

```JAVASCRIPT
// AddNewItemForm.js
import React from 'react';

function AddNewItemForm() {
  return (
    <div className="new-list-item-form">
      <form>
        <label htmlFor="new-list-form-input">
          New item:
        </label>
        
        <div className="row">
          <input
            id="new-list-form-input"
            type="text"
          />
          <button>
            Add
          </button>
        </div>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}

export default AddNewItemForm;
```

- **AC 1.** Generate the list dynamically, based on state, map over the items and generate a unique ID for the key.

```JAVASCRIPT
// App.js
import React from 'react';

import AddNewItemForm from './AddNewItemForm';

function App() {
  // add state for the items, generate id
  const [items, setItems] = React.useState([
    { label: 'Apple', id: 123 },
    { label: 'Bananna', id: 456 },
  ]);
  
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <div className="list-wrapper">
        <ol className="shopping-list">
          {items.map((item) => (
            <li key={item.id}>{item.label}</li>
          ))}
        </ol>
      </div>
      <AddNewItemForm />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- How would you add something to the list? Create a function, that will produce one of the objects and dynamically come up with a unique id and put that into state.

```JAVASCRIPT
  function handleAddItem(label) {
    // create the new item and generate unique id
    const newItem = {
      label: label,
      id: Math.random(),
    };
    // create new array, pass in the existing items, and add the new ones
    const nextItems = [...items, newItem];
    // put that into state
    setItems(nextItems);
  }
```

- Next, we have to figure out how to call this function, `handleAddItem()` pass it down as a prop to the `<AddNewItemForm />` component.

```JAVASCRIPT
// App.js
import React from 'react';

import AddNewItemForm from './AddNewItemForm';

function App() {
  // add state for the items, generate id
  const [items, setItems] = React.useState([
    { label: 'Apple', id: 123 },
    { label: 'Bananna', id: 456 },
  ]);

  function handleAddItem(label) {
    // create the new item and generate unique id
    const newItem = {
      label: label,
      id: Math.random(),
    };
    // create new array, pass in the existing items, and add the new ones
    const nextItems = [...items, newItem];
    // put that into state
    setItems(nextItems);
  }
  
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <div className="list-wrapper">
        <ol className="shopping-list">
          {items.map((item) => (
            <li key={item.id}>{item.label}</li>
          ))}
        </ol>
      </div>
      <AddNewItemForm handleAddItem={handleAddItem} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- **AC 2.** Submitting the form should add a new item to the list, and show it in the UI.

- On the `<form>` element, add an `onSubmit` handler to mange the form and button
- Add `event.preventDefault()` to stop the default browser behavior of reloading
- Call the `handleAddItem` function that was passed in via props from the parent component.
- Create a bit of state, to mange mange the new items. `const [label, setLabel] = React.useState('');`
- And pass the state `label` variable to the `handleAddItem()` function.

```JAVASCRIPT
  return (
    <div className="new-list-item-form">
      <form onSubmit={(event) => {
          // prevent the form from reloading
          event.preventDefault();
          // add a new item to the list, using new state management
          handleAddItem(label);
          // clear out the form, call the state function with empty string
          setLabel('');
        }
      }
      >
      // other stuff...
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- Now make the input controlled by the new state.
- Add `value={label}` to bind this to state
- Add a `onChange` handler to the input, to capture the content as use enters in the field.

```JAVASCRIPT
    <input
      id="new-list-form-input"
      type="text"
      value={label}
      onChange={(event) => {
        setLabel(event.target.value);
      }}
    />
```

- After you hit enter, you want to reset the form. `onSubmit` Call the set state function with an empty string. `seLabel('')`

- Good rule for managing state, you want to keep state as low as it can be, but no lower.

## Component Instances

- An important concept in React, and rarely discussed. Whenever we render a component in Rect, **we create a component instance**.
- A lot of outdated info on this topic. React has changed a ton since then.

- Video Summary:
- Where does state live? Look at a minimal React app:

```JAVASCRIPT
    import React from 'react';
    import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

    function RandomNumber() {
      const [num, setNum] = React.useState(0);

      return (
        <button onClick={() => setNum(Math.random())}>
          Current number: {num}
        </button>
      );
    }

    const root = createRoot(document.querySelector('#root'));
    root.render(
      <>
        <RandomNumber />
      </>
    );
```

- In this example; we have a react app with a little bit of state. When you click the button, we set some state in the `num`. But where does this value come from? Where does it live?
- In this example; when we call `root.render` and call the component `<RandomNumber />` **we mount this component**.

- Mounting a Component consist of two parts:
  - 1. The process of figuring out what the JSX is. Everything in the component and processing it, handlers, DOM elements and any logic. Take this description and hand it over to React, and React produces that component.
  - 2. The second part, is we create a component instance, the very first time we render a component, it creates an object. And that object knows all the information about this particular instance of the component. Each one, gets it's own instance and manged by React.

- So we mount the component, which creates this instance, and over time as we are changing the value, that value is stored on this instance.

- In another example, if you remove an instance from the DOM, conditionally render a component based on some handler. React will destroy that instance and any state that is held within that component.
- If state is stored in an instance of a component, and that component is removed by React, than you loose anything stored in state.
- The example below, state is stored in the footer. When you toggle the button to display the footer. When you toggle the footer off, React removes that instance, destroys it from the DOM, and any state stored within the footer.

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  const [
    includeFooter,
    setIncludeFooter,
  ] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Some Application</h1>
      <form className="footer-toggle-wrapper">
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          id="footer-toggle"
          checked={includeFooter}
          onChange={(event) => {
            setIncludeFooter(event.target.checked);
          }}
        />
        <label htmlFor="footer-toggle">
          Toggle Footer
        </label>
      </form>
      {includeFooter && <Footer />}
  
    </>
  );
}

function Footer() {
  const [
    backgroundColor,
    setBackgroundColor,
  ] = React.useState('#232538');

  return (
    <footer style={{ backgroundColor }}>
      <form>
        <label htmlFor="bg-picker">
          Tweak background:
        </label>
        <input
          type="color"
          id="bg-picker"
          value={backgroundColor}
          onChange={(event) => {
            setBackgroundColor(event.target.value);
          }}
        />
      </form>
      <p>
        ¬© Some Application Inc., 1998-present. All
        Rights Reserved.
      </p>
    </footer>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- What happens if you add multiple footers?

```JAVASCRIPT
{includeFooter && <Footer />}
{includeFooter && <Footer />}
{includeFooter && <Footer />}
```

- Each footer is a separate instance. And each have their own state variable.
- Each instance is independent.
- The moment we stop rendering that instance, that element gets deleted by React.
- ü§î Every time you render a component, you create an instance.

- üì£ CORE CONCEPT: State is tied to a particular component instance, so if you unmount the component, and then re-mount it, that state is gone forever.
- üì£ Or if you have the same component rendered multiple times, they all have their own version of state, because they are a separate instance.

## State Management Tools

- One of the most common questions asked: "Should we use something like Redux to manage global state for use? Or is React capable enough on it's own?

- And the answer is, it depends.

### Some background info

- In the early days, React would only be one piece of your front-end stack. The best practice was to combine React with something like Flux, Redux, or MobX.

- The idea was to use React for *local state*, and tools like Redux for *global state*.
- "Local state" is state tht is only needed in one particular part of the application. Like the value of a controlled form, input or button.
- "Global State" is for broader things, like data about the currently logged in user, or maybe the currently selected color theme. A single piece of global state might be used in a dozen different corners of the app.

- From 2014 to 2016 a number of packages were competing to be the "global state" partner for React. The outcome of that was [Redux](https://redux.js.org).

### Intro to Redux

- Summary, In Redux, the global state is represented as a single object that floats outside our React application. This state can't be directly edited; instead, Redux listens fro "actions", events that signify that something happening in our app.

- All the action are logged by Redux. For example, a log for a typical e-commerce app.
  - User logs in
  - User submits search form
  - Search results received from server
  - User clicks on "Page 2" of search results
  - Search results received from server
  - User adds "Coffee  Machine" item to cart.

- Each of these actions fires through Redux, and we can write some code that controls how these actions should affect the state.

- Like in React, state updates in Redux are immutable.

### Application Types

How to choose when to use Redux vs. native React. Most web apps fall into three categories.

1. Not much state
2. Mostly client state
3. Mostly server state

- Not Much State - This is mostly websites, static sites, news websites, and blogs fall into this category. They can still have a lot of local state, but minimal with global state.

- Mostly Client State - This is, things that used to be a desktop application. Photo shop, video editors, word processors, all fit in this category. Lots of complex global state. We are just doing a lot of state manipulation in the browser. These are client heavy apps.

- Mostly server State - Web apps that work primarily with server state. A clear example is an analytics dashboard: A bunch of complex data in the database, and our app fetches that data and presents it to the user. Apps that are interfaces that let users read and manipulate data that lives in a database somewhere. Most CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) fit into this category, most SaaS apps, social networks, search engines, e-commerce sites.

### The right tool for the job

The challenges are different for each category.

- For "Not much state" category, using just React exclusively for all state works great, not much to worry about with global state.

- Category 2, mostly client state, Redux is good choice. Redux helps to keep the code simple as it becomes more complex. And has a lot of built in performance optimizations.

- Category 3, mostly server state, most all network related.
  - Fetching the right date at the right time.
  - Making sure the data doesn't grow stale by revalidating it (re-fetching) and customizing it.
  - Caching the data sot hat multiple components don't repeat requests unnecessarily.
  - Optimistic UI updates, so that we predict how network requests will resolve.
  - Pagination, requesting small slices of the data and letting the user pull new data as needed.

- And, Redux doesn't really address any of those things, Redux is a state management tool, does not help with network stuff.

#### Network tools

- Tools to help us mange network related challenges.
  - [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com)
  - [react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/)
  - [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app)

- If you are building a video game, or audio editor, Redux is great. Most likely you are building in either Category 1 (Not much state), or Category 2 (Mostly server state)

#### Mental Model to figure out which tool

1. If it's a static website, use React alone, with the help of context
2. If client-heavy app, use Redux for global state
3. If it's a server heavy app, use React + something to help with the network stuff. For this course platform, Josh uses's Vercel's SWR.

**However**, React has evolved over the past few years, you can build large, sophisticated apps without any other state-management libraries.

ü§î If you are new to react, spend a year or two getting comfortable building apps. Then expand to other tools.

### Redux Toolkit and RTK-Query

- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org), an opinionated toolset that aims to sand down some of the rough edges of working with Redux.
-Josh prefers the "Classic Redux" without the toolkit.
- If already using Redux Toolkit, makes sense to use RTK Query.

### Bonus: Input Cheatsheet

- [Going to link to this](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/joy-of-react/02-state/11-bonus-cheatsheet), to much to write up.
- Text Inputs
- Textareas
- Radio buttons
- Checkboxes
- Select
- Specialty Inputs, range, data, color

## Project: Word Game

- In this project, we will create a clone of the popular game, Wordle.
- In Wordle, you get a new word each day, and it's your challenge to guess what the is, in six guesses or less.
- You use the colors of background, to figure out what should go where.
- Touches on a lot of the core concepts we learned in previous lessons.

### Strategies and Mindset

- This project is broken down into 5 discrete exercises. We will build the Wordle clone step by step, working up to the finished game. Each one with it's own solution, and video walkthrough.

- The flow of this project, for this project:

1. Follow the instructions in the project's README.md, attempt to solve the first exercise.
2. Once you have solved, or attempted to solve, watch the solution video for the first exercise.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all 5 exercises.

#### Growth mindset

- Struggling and failing is much more productive than effortlessly breezing through an easier challenge. In this exercise, you will feel frustrated to solve, try and reframe it as a successful learning experience. Failure is inherently frustrating.

- Shell language, when you use the terminal and press enter. That command will be interpreted by the shell language. The environment running within the terminal language.

- **Bash**, is the most popular shell language. Most of the time, online instructions will be in Bash. It is the default shell language used by most Linux distributions.

- **Zsh**, most modern MacOS versions ship with Zsh instead of Bash. And are very similar and share almost all the same commands. Can be used interchangeably.

- If you are using either Linux or MaxOS, you are good to go. Your computer already has "industry standard" shell language. If on Windows, you have some setup work todo.

- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Skip the $, in most instructions you will see a command like this. `$ npm install some-package`
- The dollar sign isn't meant to be included. You are meant to type everything after the dollar sign.
- In the Bash shell language, the `$` is the prompt character, shown to indicate that the terminal is ready to receive a command.

- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Exiting Vi / Vim, these are a PITA to exit.
- To quit without saving, use these steps:
  - Press `Escape`
  - Press `:` this should add the prompt at the bottom of the terminal.
  - Type `q!`
- If you'd like to save before quitting, you'd type `wq` (Write Quit) instead of `q!`.

### Tip N' Tricks on Terminal

- **Toggling command**, The `-` character will toggle you in between working directories, `cd -` in the terminal, kinda like the previous button on your tv remote, you can jump back and forth.

- **Clearing the terminal**, you can type `clear` and erase all commands. You can also use the shortcut, `ctrl` + `L`.

- **Switching to the GUI file explorer**, in MacOS, you can just enter `open .` to open the finder window for that directory.

- **Chaining commands**, you can chain two commands together, using the `&&` operator. The first command runs, then the second automatically. For example; `npm install && npm run start`

- **Terminal tiling and tabs**, when running a dev server, it is a long running process and is not able to accept additional commands. Modern terminal apps, you can run many terminal sessions in the same application. MacOS, the shortcut is `Shift` + `Command` + `d`.

- To run a new tab, just do `Command` + `t`

- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Tip, you can use a window position manager, like [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com) or Moom

- ‚ÑπÔ∏è VS Code Tip, to open VS Code from the MacOS terminal, `code .`, first you need to set it up in VS Code.
  - In VS Code, open the command palette with `Command` + `Shift` + `P`
  - Type `Shell` in the command palette
  - Select `Shell Command: Install code in PATH`

- ‚ÑπÔ∏è VS Code Tip, to view the markdown, run the command palette, `Command` + `Shift` + `P`, and type, `markdownopen` to view a rendered view of the markdown. or `Markdown: Open Preview`

### Running the local dev server

- Download the app from git, <https://github.com/joy-of-react/word-clone>
- cd into the project
- Run `npm install`
- And run the app, `npm run start`
- View the `README.md`

## Getting Started

- Fork the repo, on your own github, so you can submit it and review the solution videos.
- The README.md is the file you want to follow, to go through each exercise.

- My repo, forked copy: <https://github.com/clewisdavis/joy-of-react-word-clone>

- In Wordle, users have 6 attempts to guess a 5-letter word. You are helped along the way by ruling out letters that are not in the word, and being told whether the correct letters are in teh correct location or not.

### Exercise 1: GuessInput

- First thing, we need a way to submit guesses.
- We need to render a little form that holds a text input:
- Create a new component for this UI, and render it inside the `Game` component.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
- Create a new component, don't forget to use an NPM script to generate the scaffolding for you.
- This component should render a `<form>` tag, including a label and a text input.
- The text input should be controlled by React state.
- When the form is submitted:
  - The entered value should be logged to the console for now.
  - The input should be reset to an empty string.
- The user's input should be converted to ALL UPPERCASE. No lower case letters allowed.
- The input should have a minimum and maximum length of 5.
- Note: The `minLength` validator is a bit funky; you may wish to use the `pattern` attribute instead. This is discussed in mor detail on the Solution page.

- Solution, GuessInput Component

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from "react";

function GuessInput() {

  const [guess, setGuess] = React.useState('');

  function handleSubmit(event) {
    // Prevent the default browser behavior 
    event.preventDefault();
    // log to console, the {} renders in console as a object
    console.log({ guess });
    // reset the input
    setGuess('');
  }

  return (
    <>
     <form 
       className="guess-input-wrapper"
       onSubmit={handleSubmit}
      >
        <label htmlFor="guess-input">Enter guess:</label>
        <input 
          required
          minLength={5}
          maxLength={5}
          pattern="[a-zA-Z]{5}"
          title="5 letter word"
          id="guess-input"
          type="text"
          value={guess}
          onChange={ (event) => {
            const nextGuess = event.target.value.toUpperCase();
            setGuess(nextGuess);
          }}
          />
    </form>
    </>
  );
}

export default GuessInput;
```

## Exercise 2: Keeping track of the list

- The goal of this exercise is to render each of the user's guesses:

- Sample DOM structure

```JAVASCRIPT
<div class="guess-results">
  <p class="guess">FIRST</p>
  <p class="guess">GUESS</p>
</div>
```

- **Acceptance Criteria:**

- 1. A new component should be created, to render previous guesses.
- 2. When the user submits their guess, that value should be rendered within this new component.
- 3. There should be no key warnings in the console!

- Video Solution Notes:
- This exercise is tricky, seems simple, but how do you manage the state that we already have.
- The standard solution, to access data from one component to another, is to lift the state up.
- But, that does not work in this case. In this game, we only want to show the guess once it is submitted.
- When you go down the path of just lifting the state up. You see the guess as you type it, in the input field.
- What we want, the moment you type hello, and press enter, you see the guess. Transfer it, leaves the input and shows up in the list.

- Instead, you want to track, juggle the data between two bits of state.
- Create some new state, on the parent component `<Game/>`, that starts as an empty array.

```JAVASCRIPT
  const [guesses, setGuesses] = React.useState([]);
```

- Then write a new handler on the input `<GuessInput handleSubmitGuess={handleSubmitGuess}` and write the new function.
- This function will take the guess as an argument and update the guess to include in the array.

```JAVASCRIPT
  function handleSubmitGuess(guess) {
    // TODO
  }
```

- In the `<GuessInput/>` component, pass the handler in as an argument. So it can receive it.

```JAVASCRIPT
  // GuessInput.js
  function GuessInput({ handleSubmitGuess }) {
    // Component here
  }
```

- üöÄ In the `onSubmit` handler, for the input, pass that value up to the parent component, `Game.js`.

```JAVASCRIPT
  // GuessInput.js
  function handleSubmit(event) {
    // pass the value of guess up
    handleSubmitGuess(guess);
  }
```

- In the parent component, `<Game/>`, you can console.log out the guess to make sure the data is being passed from one component to another.

```JAVASCRIPT
  // Game.js
  function handleSubmitGuess(guess) {
    // Check to see if the data is being passed.
    console.log(guess);
  }
```

- In the handler, you need to add the new guess that was submitted, into the state, array. `guesses`
- Call the `setGuesses()` method to push the new guess into the array.
- Remember the rule, you are not allowed to modify existing arrays or objects.
- So we have to spread the current guess, and add the new guess

```JAVASCRIPT
  // Game.js
  function handleSubmitGuess(guess) {
    // Set state method, spread syntax, creating an array that includes all the current guesses. And add the new guess. 
    // Creates a new array, similar to array.push(), instead of modifying an existing
    setGuesses([...guesses, guess]);
  }
```

- JS Primer on the [spread syntax](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/joy-of-react/10-javascript-primer/12-rest-spread)

- Pass the array of guesses to the `<GuessResults guesses={guesses} />` component, so you can display it.
- Then we need to map over the guesses.

- Is this a bad pattern, to copy between state? Not in this case, only when you have the exact same information, that is spread across multiple state.
- But here, we have state in the input, then when you hit enter, it is being transferred to the parent level array, the list.
- We are transferring the source of truth.

- Now to render the guesses using `map()`, map over the state

```JAVASCRIPT
  function GuessResults({ guesses }) {
    return (
      <div className="guess-results">
        // map over state
        {guesses.map(guess => (
          <p className="guess">{guess}</p>
        ))}
      </div>
    )
  }
```

- Now you need to apply a unique key prop to each guess.
- You can use `index` for key, but be aware, of the re-order issue. Does you application allow for re-order.

```JAVASCRIPT
  function GuessResults({ guesses }) {
    return (
      <div className="guess-results">
        // add the key, using index
        {guesses.map((guess, index) => (
          <p key={index} className="guess">{guess}</p>
        ))}
      </div>
    )
  }
```

- What if you cannot use the `index` for the key, if the order changes or swap?
- You would have to create a unique identifier with each guess. And that happens in your `handleSubmitGuess()` handler.

```JAVASCRIPT
  // Game.js
  function handleSubmitGuess(tentativeGuess) {

    // Create an object to hold the value and the unique id
    const nextGuess = {
      value: tentativeGuess,
      id: Math.random(), // set a unique id, 15 digits
    }
    // set that in the array for state, so now every item is going to be an object
    setGuesses([...guesses, nextGuess]);
  }
```

- Now in your `<GuessResults />` component.
- You can deconstruct that `{value, id}` and then use it on the component.

```JAVASCRIPT
  function GuessResults({ guesses }) {
    return (
      <div className="guess-results">
        // add the key, using index
        {guesses.map(({value, id}, index) => (
          <p key={id} className="guess">{value}</p>
        ))}
      </div>
    )
  }
```

## Exercise 3: Guess Slots

- Hint: You will need to generate a bunch of squares for each guess. This can be done using the provided [range utility](https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/joy-of-react/01-fundamentals/08-range-util).

- In this exercise, we will update our code to display 6 rows of guesses, no matter how many guesses the user has submitted, and each row will consist of 5 cells.
- As the user submits guesses, their guess will populate the cells:

- Starter markup for the slots

```HTML
<div class="guess-results">
  <p class="guess">
    <span class="cell">F</span>
    <span class="cell">I</span>
    <span class="cell">R</span>
    <span class="cell">S</span>
    <span class="cell">T</span>
  </p>
  <p class="guess">
    <span class="cell">G</span>
    <span class="cell">U</span>
    <span class="cell">E</span>
    <span class="cell">S</span>
    <span class="cell">S</span>
  </p>
  <p class="guess">
    <span class="cell"></span>
    <span class="cell"></span>
    <span class="cell"></span>
    <span class="cell"></span>
    <span class="cell"></span>
  </p>
  <p class="guess">
    <span class="cell"></span>
    <span class="cell"></span>
    <span class="cell"></span>
    <span class="cell"></span>
    <span class="cell"></span>
  </p>
  <p class="guess">
    <span class="cell"></span>
    <span class="cell"></span>
    <span class="cell"></span>
    <span class="cell"></span>
    <span class="cell"></span>
  </p>
</div>
```

- Things to know to help with this exercise:

1. You can use the `range` utility to create array sof a specified length to map over. It's provided in `/src/utils.js`. Check out range utility lesson for more info.
2. Inside `/src/constants.js`, you find a constant, `NUM_OF_GUESSES_ALLOWED`. You should import and use this constant when generating the set of guesses. This would make it easy for us to change the difficulty of the game later on, bu increasing/decreasing the # of guesses.

- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Create a new `Guess` component. 6 instances should be rendered at all times, no matter how many guesses have been submitted.
  - The `Guess` component should render 5 spans, each with the class of `cell`.
  - Each cell should contain a letter, if the `Guess` instance has been given a value. If not, the cell should be blank.
  - Use the `NUM_OF_GUESSES_ALLOWED` constant, when needed.
  - No `key` warnings in the console.

- Create a new component, but how do you split up the guesses and put them in each box?

```JAVASCRIPT
    function Guess({ value }) {
      return (
        <>
          <p className="guess">
            {
              // split up the guesses and map through
              value.split('').map((letter, index)) => (
                <span key={index} className="cell">
                  {letter}
                </span>
              )
            }
          </p>
        </>
      )
    }
```

## Exercise 4: Game logic

- In this exercise, we will add some CSS classes to color the background of each cell, based on the results and the correct answer:

- Inside `/src/game-helpers.js` you will find a helper function, `checkGuess`. As parameters, it takes a single guess, as well as the correct answer. It returns an array that contains the status for each letter.

- For example:

```JAVASCRIPT
checkGuess('WHALE', 'LEARN');
/*
  Returns:

  [
    { letter: 'W', status: 'incorrect' },
    { letter: 'H', status: 'incorrect' },
    { letter: 'A', status: 'correct' },
    { letter: 'L', status: 'misplaced' },
    { letter: 'E', status: 'misplaced' },
  ]
*/
```

- There are 3 possible statuses:
  - correct - this slot is perfect.
  - misplaced - this letter does exist in the word, but in a different slot.
  - incorrect - this letter is not found in the word at all.

- In the example above, `W` and `H` are not found in the word `LEARN`, and so they are marked as "incorrect". `A` is correct, since it is in the 3rd slot in each word. The other two letters `L` and `E` are meant to be in other slots.

- These statuses correspond with CSS classes. the `correct` status has a `correct` class name, which will apply the green background when applied to a cell. Same thing for `misplaced` and `incorrect`.

- The task is to use this function to validate the user's guesses, and apply the correct CSS classes. The final output for a given guess should look like this:

```HTML
<p class="guess">
  <span class="cell incorrect">W</span>
  <span class="cell incorrect">H</span>
  <span class="cell correct">A</span>
  <span class="cell misplaced">L</span>
  <span class="cell misplaced">E</span>
</p>
```

- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Import the `checkGuess` function from `/src/game-helpers.js` and use it to validate each of the user's guesses.
  - When rendering the letter in the `Guess` component, apply the letter's `status` to the `cell` element.
  - Empty guess slots should have the same markup as before: `<span class="cell"></span>`

## Exercise 5: Winning and loosing

- The last thing to do, is to end the game.
- If the user wins the game, a happy banner should be shown:
- If the user loses teh game, by contrast, a sad banner should be shown:

- The user wins teh game when their guessed word is identical to the `answer`. They lose the game if they submit six guesses without winning.

- When the game is over, one of these banners should be shown, and the text input should be disabled sot hat no new guesses can be typed or submitted.

**- Acceptance Criteria:**

- If the user wins the game, a happy banner should be shown.
- If the user loses the game, a sad banner should be shown.
- When teh game is over, the text input should be disabled.
- It is up to your to decide hwo to structure the banner. Feel free to create a new component if you think it's warranted.
