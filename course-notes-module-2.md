## Working with State

- In the early days of the web, websites were basically fancy documents, we would load one HTML file, read the content and then load another one.

- The modern web is interactive. The app can respond to user actions in real time. Without the need to fetch the whole page.

- In this module:
  - How to respond to user actions with event binding.
  - How React manages the DOM for us, and what it means to re-render.
  - The `useState` hook and how to use it to build interactive components.
  - Understand the difference between props and state.
  - Working with forms in React.
  - Working with complex state, like objects and arrays.
  - Avoiding common pitfalls, state mutation.
  - How to share state across the application by lifting it up.

- Going from static websites to dynamic alive apps!
