# The Joy of React

Course notes from clewisdavis, for future reference.

- Start date February 2023

## Module 1

- The magic of React, you write code that describes what the UI should be based on. React will figure out what's changed and update the UI.
- History of React and how it got started at [FB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYkdrAPrdcw&t=624s).

### Hello React

- Start with a hello world React App, using pure JS.

1. Import dependencies

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
```

- Import the core React library from the `react` dependency and the `createRoot` function from the `react-dom`
- React is platform agnostic, you have the core `react` package, and then you have platform-specific renders:
  - `react-dom` for the web
  - `react-native` for mobile (iOS / Android) or desktop (Windows / MacOS) apps
  - `react-three-fiber` for 3D scenes using WebGL and Three.js
- All the platfoms use the same core framework, `react`, but you have to specify the correct package based on what you are building.

- You can use the React skills you learn, to build apps across platforms.

- What is the DOM?
  - It's an HTML blueprint of a house, and the DOM is the house itself.
  - Rect, works by interacting with teh DOM via JS. To create, update, and delete DOM elements as required.
  - Document Object Model.

2. Create a React element

- With the following code.

```JAVASCRIPT
const element = React.createElement(
  'p',
  { id: 'hello' },
  'Hello World!',
);
```

- The `React.createElement()` is a function that accepts 3 or more arguments.
    1. The type of element
    2. The properties we want this elemetn to have
    3. The element's contents, what the element should have as children.

- This function returns a React element. Plain old JS objects, if you console log it, you will see it's a description of a paragraph tg.

- DOM hierarchy, is organized like a tree, elements have parents, sibling and children.
- React elements form a hierarchy just like the DOM elements do.

3. Render the application

- The code to mount and render the application

```JAVASCRIPT
const container = document.querySelector('#root');
const root = createRoot(container);
root.render(element);
```

- The `document.querySelector` is a reference point of the exsiting DOM element.
- In your `inded.html` file, you include the `id="root"` element to the DOM element you want to mount the app. `<div id="root"></div>`

- This element wil be the apps container.
- This element will be the root of our app.

- And the render the application with `root.render(element)`.
- The `render` function converts Rect elements into DOM nodes.
- In this case, react describes a paragraph tag, an dID and some text.
- `render` will turn that description into the following DOM element.

```HTML
<p id="hello">
  Hello World!
</p>
```

- With taht DOM element craeted, it adds it to the page at the specified root.
- **It takes a JS based description of some HTML, and uses it to produce real-world DOM nodes.**

- But, the real magic happens when things change.
- NOTE: React 17, used an different API syntax from the example above.

## Build your own React

- Build your own `render` funtion that takes React elements and produces the equivlent DOM struture.

- Write a `render` function that accepts a Rect element and a reference to a DOM contianer element that will hold our app.

- Acceptance criteria:
  - A link should be shown in the "result" pane, linking to a wikipedia.org, adn with the text "Read more on Wikipedia"
  - It should work with any element type (eg anchors, paragraphs, button...)
  - It shoud lhandle all HTML attributes (eg. href, id, disabled...)
  - The element should contain the text specidied uner `children`. `children` will always be a stiring.

```JAVASCRIPT
// SOLUTION
function render(reactElement, containerDOMElement) {
  // 1. create a DOM element
  const domElement = document.createElement(reactElement.type);

  // 2. update properties
  domElement.innerText = reactElement.children;
  for (const key in reactElement.props) {
    const value = reactElement.props[key];
    domElement.setAttribute(key, value);
  }

  // 3. put it in the container
  containerDOMElement.appendChild(domElement);
}
```

- Boils down to, React takes an JS object, and describes how to build the DOM elements.
- React takes those descriptions, and creates the real DOM.  
- React-DOM, is the translator, takes the descriptions we product in JS, and builds, produces the real version of them.

- Remember, it's a JS framework, and fundamentally uses the same things you would use, if building in JS.

### Productive failure

- A learning method used from academic.
- n Productive Failure, the conventional instruction process is reversed so that learners attempt to solve challenging problems ahead of receiving explicit instruction. While students often fail to produce satisfactory solutions (hence “Failure”), these attempts help learners encode key features and learn better from subsequent instruction (hence “Productive”).
- Much more likely to remember things, if you fail first, not given all the instructions ahead of time.
- Struggling means you are learning, and growing.

- The growth mindset, we become smarter through practice, and failure is the fastest way to learn.

## Understanding JSX

- In the previous example, we used everyday JS.
- In reality, most engineers use a syntax called JSX
- For example:

```JAVASCRIPT
// // Old way:
// const element = React.createElement(
//   'p',
//   {
//     id: 'hello',
//   },
//   'Hello World!'
// );

// New way:
const element = (
  <p id="hello">
    Hello World!
  </p>
);
```

- Instead of writing `Rect.createElement`, we use an HTML like syntax to create React elements.

- Why use JSX? As your codebase grows, it becomes easier to read with JSX.
- React elemetns can form a tree structure, just like HTML. This happens when we set the "children" parameter of a React element to another React element.

- Written out, we wind up with a really long tree structures that are hard to read using plain JS:

```JAVASCRIPT
// Plain JS:
const element = React.createElement(
  'nav',
  { id: 'main-nav' },
  React.createElement(
    'ul',
    null,
    React.createElement(
      'li',
      null,
      React.createElement(
        'a',
        { href: '/' },
        'Home',
      ),
    ),
    React.createElement(
      'li',
      null,
      React.createElement(
        'a',
        { href: '/archives' },
        'Archives',
      ),
    ),
  ),
);
```

- Now compare that same markup in JSX, much easier to read.

```HTML
// In JSX:
const element = (
  <nav id="main-nav">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/">
          Home
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/archives">
          Archives
        </a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
);
```

- ℹ️ Why the parenthesis around the JSX? This is for formatting purposes. Allows us to push the JSX onto hte next line. Even outside of JSX/React, Parentheses can be used to improve formatting.

### Compiling JSX into JS

- If you try and run the JSX code int he browser, you will get an error.
- JS engines don't understand JSX, they only under stand JS.
- We need to compile our code into plain JS.

- This is done in a build step, tools like Babel.

- ℹ️ The JSX we write gets converted into `React.createElement`. By the time our code is running int he user's browser, al the JSX has been zapped out, and we are left wtih a JS file, full of nested `React.createElement` calls.

- React import? Best practive to always import React, `import React from 'react';`
- In JSX, it's obfuscated, meaning it's not used by JSX, only after JSX becomes compiled into `React.createElement`

### Expression Slots

- When you want to see the result of an expression, you have to wrap it in a `{}`
- But what is actaully going on here?

```JAVASCRIPT
import { render } from 'react-dom';

const shoppingList = ['apple', 'banana', 'carrot'];

const element = (
  <div>
      Items left to purchase: shoppingList.length
  </div>
);

const root = document.querySelector('#root');

render(element, root);
```

- In this example, shoppingList.length is unprocessed, just renders as a string.
- You can fix this by wrapping it in a `{}`, and it processed it as JS, instead fo a static sting.
- What are the rules for this?
  - React is doing very little here, it's the rules on the JS side you have to pay attention to.

- The pure JS version of this is.

```JAVASCRIPT
const compiledElement = React.createElement(
  'div',
  {},
  'Items left to purchase: shoppingList.length',
);
```

- When you add the `{}`, you create an EXPRESSION SLOT
- This is a slot we can put any JS expression in, and it will be forwarded along by React.

```JAVASCRIPT
const element = (
  <div>
      Items left to purchase:
    {shoppingList.length}
  </div>
);

const compiledElement = React.createElement(
  'div',
  {},
  'Items left to purchase: ',
  shoppingList.length,
);
```

- All React is doing, whatever is in the `{}` gets forwarded along, and when React compiles the JSX into pure JS.
- This means we are subject to all the rules of JS.

- Have to understand the difference between statements vs. expressions.
- For example, you cannot just put an `if()` statement.
- Only allowed to use expressions within our JSX.
- You can put any valid expression in the `{}`, for example; `{Math.random()}`

- You must use `expressions`, because you cannot use `statements` in the middle of a function call.

### Comments in JSX

- To add a comment in JSX, we use experssoin slot:

```JAVASCRIPT
const element = (
    <div>
     {/* some comment */}
    <div>
);
```

- Single line syntax comments everythign out, including the `{}` for the expression slot.

### Attribute expressoin slots

- We can use the same trick for dynamic attritbute values.

```JAVASCRIPT
const someIdentifier = 'some-unique-identifier';

const element = (
  <div id={someIdentifier}>
      Hello World
  </div>
);
```

- This allos su to craete expression slots for the valeu of the `id` attribute.
- How it compiles.

```JAVASCRIPT
const element = React.createElement(
  'div',
  {
    id: someIdentifier,
  },
  'Hello World',
);
```

- Only two ways to use expression slots, to dynamically calculate children, or attributes.

### Type coercion

- React wil automaticaly convert types as required when supplying attributes in JSX.
- These are identical.

```JAVASCRIPT
// This works:
<input required="true" />

// And so does this
<input required={true} />
```

- In the first example, we set the requried attribute as a string `"true"`, second example, it's set as a boolean attribute `true`. Either way, the input will wind up being required.

- You can also pass numbers or strings for numberic attribute:

```JAVASCRIPT
// ✅ Valid
<input type="range" min="1" max="20" />
// ✅ Valid
<input type="range" min={1} max={20} />
```

- ℹ️ Boolean attributes:
- In HTML, it's possibel to set attributes to `true` just by specifying only the key.
- `<input required>`
- In JSX, these are equivilant:
- `<input requried />` and `<input required={true} />`
- Prefer to spell it out.
