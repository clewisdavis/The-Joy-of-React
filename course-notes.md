# The Joy of React

Course notes from clewisdavis, for future reference.

- Start date February 2023

## Module 1

- The magic of React, you write code that describes what the UI should be based on. React will figure out what's changed and update the UI.
- History of React and how it got started at [FB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYkdrAPrdcw&t=624s).

### Hello React

- Start with a hello world React App, using pure JS.

1. Import dependencies

```JAVASCRIPT
import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
```

- Iport the core React library from the `react` dependency and the `createRoot` function from the `react-dom`
- React is platform agnostic, you have the core `react` package, and then you have platform-specific renders:
  - `react-dom` for the web
  - `react-native` for mobile (iOS / Android) or desktop (Windows / MacOS) apps
  - `react-three-fiber` for 3D scenes using WebGL and Three.js
- All the platfoms use the same core framework, `react`, but you have to specify the correct package based on what you are building.

- You can use the React skills you learn, to build apps across platforms.

- What is the DOM?
  - It's an HTML blueprint of a house, and the DOM is the house itself.
  - Rect, works by interacting with teh DOM via JS. To create, update, and delete DOM elements as required.
  - Document Object Model.

2. Create a React element

- With the following code.

```JAVASCRIPT
const element = React.createElement(
  'p',
  { id: 'hello' },
  'Hello World!',
);
```

- The `React.createElement()` is a function that accepts 3 or more arguments.
    1. The type of element
    2. The properties we want this elemetn to have
    3. The element's contents, what the element should have as children.

- This function returns a React element. Plain old JS objects, if you console log it, you will see it's a description of a paragraph tg.

- DOM hierarchy, is organized like a tree, elements have parents, sibling and children.
- React elements form a hierarchy just like the DOM elements do.

3. Render the application
